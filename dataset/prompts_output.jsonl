According to a new report, the search giant could lay off as many as 30,000 employees as it gets ready to build use cases for AI to take over from humans.\n\nThe report comes via The Information, which says that Google is going to restructure its ad sales department which seems to be seeing the benefits of using AI for its operations. In fact, bringing AI on board could lead to a massive churn at Google, the report suggests. AI is expected to play a big part in the changing revenue stream of digital advertising from the platform, which has a major effect on people being employed to do these tasks.\n\nGoogle is also testing AI in its customer support service these days which has a direct impact on the human-side of operations at the company. Google has been in the news for handing out pink slips earlier this year as well. The headlines never make for a rosy reading but Google CEO, Sundar Pichai decided to address the need to realign the business and that unfortunately ends up costing people jobs.\n\nAt Google, around 12,000 people were already laid off as highlighted in multiple reports. The Google CEO said, “It would have been a major overhang on the company. I think it would have made it very difficult in a year like this with such a big shift in the world to create the capacity to invest in areas.”\n\nThere is no doubt that businesses will have to make these decisions, but the need to churn staff to integrate AI will probably face more scrutiny from a company that makes billions across different businesses.\n###Assistant: (Verse 1)\nGoogle hai busy, AI model bana rahe hain,\nApni business ke liye, AI ke saath chalne ki baat chhupi hai.\nThe Information ki report ke mutabiq, 30,000 jobs jaane ka khadsha hai,\nAI ko lekar, Google tayyar ho raha hai, humans ko replace karne ki taiyari hai.\n\n(Chorus)\nAI se hoga sab kuch, oh oh oh,\nGoogle mein layoff, oh oh oh.\nAd sales department mein restructuring, hai charcha ka vishay,\nDigital advertising ka stream badalne mein, AI ka kheyal hai.\n\n(Verse 2)\nAI ka istemal, customer support mein bhi ho raha test,\nYeh chhoot jaayegi jobs ko, yeh hai ek naya zest.\nEarlier this year, pink slips hue they distribute,\nSundar Pichai ne bola, business realign karna padta hai, yeh hai ek sad reality.\n\n(Bridge)\n12,000 logon ko pehle hi, Google ne kaha alvida,\nCEO ne kaha, company ke liye tha zaroori yeh vida.\nDuniya mein hua major shift, investment karne mein mushkil thi,\nAI ke saath integration, hai yeh ek tough journey.\n\n(Verse 3)\nBusinesses ko lena padta hai yeh tough decisions,\nAI ko adopt karna, hai ek complex mission.\nBillions kamate hain, Google alag alag businesses se,\nAI integration ke liye, hoga yeh decision intense.\n\n(Chorus)\nAI se hoga sab kuch, oh oh oh,\nGoogle mein layoff, oh oh oh.\nAd sales department mein restructuring, hai charcha ka vishay,\nDigital advertising ka stream badalne mein, AI ka kheyal hai.\n\n(Outro)\nFuture mein dekhenge, kaise badlegi yeh game,\nAI ke saath, Google karega apna naam."}

The mission, which cost a mere $75 million, not only positioned India as a major player in space exploration but also showcased the country's ability to execute complex space missions economically.\n\nThe lander's journey to the Moon was meticulously planned, with its orbit insertion being a testament to the precision and expertise of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The spacecraft achieved an orbit of 164 km x 18074 km, followed by a translunar orbit of 288 km x 369328 km, as intended.\n\nDespite facing challenges, the mission's success was attributed to the relentless efforts of Isro's scientists and their ability to learn from past failures. It landed and conducted experiments on the surface of the Moon.\n\nWith the successful mission, India became the first country to land a spacecraft in the Moon's South Pole region.\n\nChandayaan-3\nADITYA-L1'S RISE TO UNRAVEL THE SUN\nFollowing the lunar feat, Isro's focus shifted toward the Sun with the launch of the Aditya-L1 mission on September 2.\n\nThis mission marked a significant milestone in solar research as it captured its first high-energy solar flare using the High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS).\n\nDeveloped by the Space Astronomy Group at ISRO's UR Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, HEL1OS is designed to monitor high-energy X-ray activity from the Sun. During its initial observation phase, the instrument recorded data consistent with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (NOAA's GOES), confirming the reliability of its findings.\n\nIt will reach its destination, Lagrange Point 1, on January 6, 2024.\n\nSun\nAI MAKES A BIG SPLASH\nIndian researchers made significant strides in developing AI-powered tools for healthcare applications. An AI system developed by the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, achieved promising results in early-stage detection of lung cancer, showing potential for improving diagnosis and treatment outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, researchers at IIT Jodhpur created an AI platform to predict the risk of diabetes-related complications, paving the way for personalized preventive care.\n\nThe National Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) predicts that the AI in Healthcare Market will grow from $14.6 billion in 2023 to $102.7 billion by 2028. This growth is expected to contribute significantly to India's GDP, highlighting the potential of AI in revolutionizing the healthcare industry.\n\nArtificial intelligence brain\nAI made a big splash across sectors in 2023. (Photo: Getty)\nINDIA JOINS ARTEMIS ACCORDS\nIndia's commitment to international collaboration in space exploration was further solidified with the signing of the Artemis Accords.\n\nBy becoming a signatory, India joined a global effort to establish a practical set of principles guiding space exploration cooperation among nations. This move aligns with India's eagerness to participate in lunar exploration missions and work alongside countries like the United States on future Moon missions.\n\nThe accords also paved the way for a collaboration between Nasa and Isro to send an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station.\n\nADVANCING SOLAR TECH\nIndia's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has been making progress in solar cell technology, contributing to the nation's push towards renewable energy sources. Highly efficient solar cell technology using perovskite materials, potentially bringing us closer to affordable and widespread solar energy production.\n\nAdditionally, significant progress was made in developing lithium-ion battery technologies with longer lifespans and faster charging times, crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.\n\nAs we reflect on the year gone by, it is evident that India's scientific community has not only achieved impressive milestones but has also laid the groundwork for future innovations in 2024.###Assistant: (Verse 1)\nSaal 2023, aakar chala gaya,\nBharat ne banaye, naye itihas ka kamaal.\n\nChandrayaan-3 ne kiya, Moon par kadam,\n75 million mein, hua yeh saara kaam.\nISRO ke engineers, dikhaye apne dum,\nSpace exploration mein, ban gaye hum kaamyaab.\n\n(Chorus)\nGroundbreaking achievements, oh oh oh,\nScience aur tech mein, oh oh oh.\nChandrayaan-3 ne kiya leap, Moon pe oh oh oh,\nAditya-L1 ne kiya rise, Sun ke paas oh oh oh.\n\n(Verse 2)\nAditya-L1 mission, Sun ko samajhne gaya,\nHEL1OS se kiya, solar flare ka safar.\nISRO ke scientists, ne kiya kaam pyara,\nSolar research mein, bana naya itihas humara.\n\nAI ne bhi dikhaya, apna jalwa,\nIISc, Bangalore, lung cancer ka halwa.\nIIT Jodhpur ne banaya, AI platform,\nDiabetes ke risk ko predict karna, hua norm.\n\n(Bridge)\nArtemis Accords mein, Bharat ne sign kiya,\nSpace exploration mein, badhaya apna hissa.\nCollaboration with NASA, aur ISRO ne milke,\nInternational Space Station, bhejenge ek astronaut.\n\n(Verse 3)\nSolar tech mein bhi, Bharat ne kiya progress,\nNational Renewable Energy Lab, banaya success.\nPerovskite materials se, efficient solar cell,\nRenewable energy ko leke, badha hai yeh ek deal.\n\nLithium-ion battery, bhi hui advance,\nElectric vehicles ke liye, aur storage ke trance.\nSaal 2023 mein, Bharat ne dikhaya dum,\nScience aur tech mein, humne kiya kamaal hum.\n\n(Chorus)\nGroundbreaking achievements, oh oh oh,\nScience aur tech mein, oh oh oh.\nChandrayaan-3 ne kiya leap, Moon pe oh oh oh,\nAditya-L1 ne kiya rise, Sun ke paas oh oh oh.\n\n(Outro)\nSaal beet gaya, lekin kamaal reh gaya,\nBharat ke scientists, ne banaya naya pal."}

Click here\nRead here: At Jaishankar, Sergey Lavrov meeting, a push to expand export of Russian energy\n\nDespite pressure from the US and its European partners following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India ramped up purchases of Russian energy and other commodities such as fertilisers. The Indian side has consistently called for the end of hostilities in Ukraine but has refrained from publicly criticising Russia’s actions.\n\nFollowing his talks with Jaishankar, Lavrov described energy cooperation as a “strategic area” of the overall relationship that Russia intends to strengthen. He told a joint news conference: “We agreed on the expansion of the exports of Russian hydrocarbons to the Indian market as well as the cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”\n\nJaishankar described Russian supplies of energy, coking coal and fertilisers as “very big components” of bilateral trade and said the two sides talked about long-term arrangements for these commodities. “How do we reach long-term arrangements in that regard was a big part of our discussion,” he said.\n\nIndia has a “very substantial” energy relationship with Russia in terms of investments in Russian oil and gas, “which we are seeking to expand”, Jaishankar said. The two sides are also looking to expand cooperation in nuclear energy. “Yesterday [Tuesday], we signed two important amendments which will take the Kudankulam nuclear power project forward,” he added.\n\nOn Tuesday, India and Russia signed agreements to move forward with future units of the Kudankulam nuclear power project in Tamil Nadu, which will have six reactors with a capacity of 1,000 MW each. The first two reactors became operational in 2014 and 2016 and work is underway on two more. Both sides haven’t offered details of the agreements though people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that they are related to the fifth and sixth reactors, construction of which began in 2021.\n\nDespite India’s agreements with the US and France on civil nuclear cooperation, Russia is currently the only country building atomic reactors in India. Lavrov described Russia’s involvement in this sphere as “our practical contribution to India’s activities and work to satisfy its national needs for clean and safe energy”.\n\nThe two sides also discussed prospects for cooperation in piloted space programmes, rocket engines, satellite navigation systems and military hardware. Lavrov said Russia is “respectful” of India’s aspiration to diversify its “military and technical links” and is ready to support efforts to produce military equipment under the “Make in India” initiative.\n\nMore than 60% of the equipment and weapons systems used by India’s armed forces continue to be of Russian origin, though New Delhi has stepped up efforts in recent years to acquire more Western platforms such as submarines, long-range transport aircraft, and helicopters.\n\nThe Ukraine conflict and the situation in Gaza, Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific also figured in the meeting between Jaishankar and Lavrov. India’s position on the issue of Ukraine reflects its “responsible approach towards regional and global issues” based primarily on national interests and the interests of fair international cooperation, Lavrov said.\n\nIndia and Russia have a shared interest in Eurasia and surrounding waters to seek solutions that “would not provoke any confrontational approaches which are sometimes brought to the region from the outside”, Lavrov said.\n\nThe two sides further discussed ways to bolster trade and connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), establishing the Chennai-Vladivostok sea route, and cooperation in exploring the northern polar sea route. They also talked about cooperation in Russia’s Far East and at multilateral forums such as the United Nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping. The Russian side reiterated its support for India’s permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council.\n\nResponding to a question on the Western perception that India’s relationship with Russia is a handicap, Jaishankar said Moscow is a very valued and time-tested partner for New Delhi.\n\n“It’s a relationship from which both India and Russia have benefited enormously. My presence here today and...all the developments I have pointed out, including our growing trade, investments, military-technical cooperation and connectivity projects, I think all of this will give you a good sense of really the importance and the value that we attach to the relationship,” he said.\n\nLavrov, in his opening remarks, said: “Our cooperation is of a strategic nature, strengthening it corresponds to the national interests of our states [and] the interests of maintaining security in the Eurasian continent.”\n\nJaishankar’s visit assumed greater significance as India and Russia could not hold their annual leaders’ summit for the second consecutive year. Responding to a question on this issue, Jaishankar said this year’s annual meetings could not be held because of India’s G20 presidency and “certain preoccupations”. He added, “But I’m very confident that we will see an annual summit next year.”\n\nRead here: Vladimir Putin invites PM Modi to visit Russia next year\n\nThe external affairs minister also reiterated India’s concerns about the imbalance in trade with Russia, which rose to $50 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow further this year because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian energy.\n\n“Today, we appreciated the fact that our trade is at an all-time high. We crossed $50 billion turnover last year. We expect to exceed that this year and what is important is that this trade is more balanced, sustainable and provides for fair market access,” he said.###Assistant: (Verse 1)\nRusso-Indian dosti, ek naya safar shuru,\nJaishankar aur Lavrov, ne kiya milan pyara.\n\nEnergy, coal, aur fertilisers, hai humare beech,\nBharat aur Russia, ek saath hai speech.\n\n(Chorus)\nRusso-Indian connection, oh oh oh,\nEnergy export, oh oh oh.\nJaishankar-Lavrov ka plan, oh oh oh,\nSath mein badhe, yeh humara goal.\n\n(Verse 2)\nUS pressure ho ya phir, Europe ka saath,\nUkraine ke baad bhi, humne kiya trade ka haath.\nRussian energy ka purchase, hua bada,\nFertilisers bhi mile, hai yeh wada.\n\nLavrov ne kaha, energy is strategic,\nExports expand karenge, yeh hai target specific.\nJaishankar bola, energy, coal, fertilisers,\nHain components bade, trade ke investors.\n\n(Bridge)\nNuclear energy mein bhi, badha hai step,\nKudankulam project, hai humara precept.\nSpace programs, rocket engines, military tech,\nHai humare agenda mein, yeh sab ka ek peck.\n\n(Verse 3)\n60% se zyada, hai humara reliance,\nRussian equipment aur weapons, humara preference.\nUkraine, Gaza, Indo-Pacific ki baat,\nJaishankar aur Lavrov, ne kiya charcha ka izhaar.\n\nINSTC, Chennai-Vladivostok route,\nTrade aur connectivity, hai humara shout.\nUN, SCO, Brics, mein bhi saath,\nRussia ne diya support, humare permanent seat ka baath.\n\n(Chorus)\nRusso-Indian connection, oh oh oh,\nEnergy export, oh oh oh.\nJaishankar-Lavrov ka plan, oh oh oh,\nSath mein badhe, yeh humara goal.\n\n(Outro)\nRusso-Indian dosti, hai strong aur old,\nTrade, tech, aur diplomacy, hai yeh bold.\nJaishankar ne kaha, Moscow hamara valuable partner,\nAage bhi badhega, yeh dosti ka chapter."}

Click here\nThe larger case involves fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, who is under investigation by multiple agencies for money-laundering, violation of foreign exchange and black money laws, and the Official Secrets Act. He fled India for the UK in 2016. Thampi has been accused of facilitating Bhandari to hide proceeds of crime, along with Sumit Chadha, a British national.\n\nThough ED has named Robert Vadra in earlier charge sheets related to the case as a close aide of Thampi, this is the first time that Priyanka Gandhi has been mentioned in an official document submitted to court.\n\nIn the latest charge sheet, filed in November and reviewed by HT on Wednesday, the federal agency has alleged that estate agent HL Pahwa, who sold properties to both Vadra and Thampi, received cash out of the books for the land purchase in Haryana, and that Vadra did not pay the full amount for the sale. Pahwa also sold agricultural land to Priyanka Gandhi in 2006 and bought it back from her in 2010, the agency said.\n\nTo be sure, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi have not been named as accused, and the land transactions have been mentioned to draw a link between Thampi and Vadra.\n\nA press release by the agency on Tuesday, which HT reported, also mentioned Vadra in connection with the purchase of a property in London that is part of the probe.Detailing the association between Vadra and Thampi, the charge sheet states, “During the course of investigation in this case, it is found that a long and thick relationship exists between CC Thampi and Robert Vadra. Not only a personal/cordial bond but common and similar business interests are also found between them.”\n\nThampi, arrested in January 2020, ostensibly told ED that he knew Vadra for over 10 years and that they met several times during Vadra’s visits to the UAE as well as in Delhi. ED has said that Thampi used the services of Pahwa to buy 486 acres of land from 2005 to 2008 in village Amipur in Faridabad, Haryana.\n\n“It is imperative to mention that Robert Vadra also purchased three pieces of land measuring 334 kanals (40.08 acres) in Amipur from [the same] HL Pahwa from 2005-2006 and sold the same land to Pahwa in December 2010. Further, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, wife of Robert Vadra, also purchased agricultural land measuring 40 kanal (5 acres) in village Amipur from Pahwa in April 2006 and sold the same land to Pahwa in February 2010,” the charge sheet said\n\nPahwa, according to ED, was receiving cash out of the books for the acquisition of land. “It was also noticed that Robert Vadra did not pay the entire sale consideration to Pahwa,” agency has said, while adding that “investigation in this regard is still ongoing”. ED has also provided details of other financial transactions between Vadra and Thampi. For instance, it has claimed, that Thampi purchased a Land Cruiser car from Vadra for which payments were made through cheques from his NRE (non-resident external) account.\n\nAbout the London property under probe, ED has claimed that Bhandari acquired it in December 2009 and it was renovated using Robert Vadra’s funds. Vadra also stayed in the property -- 12, Bryanston Square -- “three-four times”, ED said. “The common thread with regard to the said (London) property starting from the date of acquisition to its use was CC Thampi, Sumit Chadha and Robert Vadra,” it added.\n\nRead here: Avinash Pande replaces Priyanka Gandhi as Congress' UP in-charge\n\nED has claimed since 2020 that the property in question, worth 1.9 million pounds at the time, belongs to Vadra, and that Thampi played a crucial role in its purchase.\n\nHT reached out to Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi for comments but did not get a response till the time of going to print, however, earlier inJanuary 2020 he had said:“It’s a free for all in this country…truth has no place.

{"text": "###Human: A textbook introduced for students in Russia claims that former United States President Donald Trump did not win the 2020 presidential elections due to voter fraud which was committed by the Democrats.   \n\nThe images of the content in the history book - which is being reportedly studied by students in the 11th grade - are being circulated on social media platforms in recent days. A page from the book was posted by a foreign correspondent for The Times (UK), Marc Bennetts on his X account and he translated the text in the book which read - Trump lost the election \"as a result of obvious electoral fraud by the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\nTrump, along with his allies, has been facing criminal charges and has been accused of interfering with the 2020 election results in which President Joe Biden emerged victorious. Meanwhile, claims by Trump of the election being rigged have been widely debunked in the courts and other judicial places.\n\nAlso read: Lavrov hails 'mutually beneficial' India-Russia ties, Jaishankar calls Moscow a 'time-tested partner'\n\nTRENDING NOW\n\nTrump has also faced criticism for complimenting Russian President Vladimir Putin even though he has condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Still, few Russian analysts have said that the Kremlin is likely to prefer Trump over Biden in 2024.\n\nProfessor at the University of Chicago, Konstantin Sonin, who has been writing frequently about Russian politics, talked about the claims in Russian textbooks regarding the 2020 election, on X.\n\nTextbook makes unproven claims\nSpeaking to Newsweek about the textbook, Sonin said that he didn't doubt the content's authenticity and that the publication of the book was announced earlier this year in a press conference by the authors of the book and Russia's Minister of Education Sergei Kravstov. \n\nAnother excerpt from the textbook was shared by Bennetts on X, which included Biden's photograph wearing a mask which was designed to curb the spread of respiratory illnesses.\n\nWatch: Russia-Ukraine war: Russia's defence sector booms amid gains in Ukraine war | Gravitas\n\n\nAs per Bennetts, the excerpt included some unproven claims regarding President Biden. \"On (masked) Biden from the same Russian school textbook 'His entire political career has been accompanied by corruption scandals. He and his family have commercial interests in Ukraine,'\" wrote Bennetts. \n\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine by Putin in February 2022, Biden has been one of the strongest allies of Kyiv and has been pledging more support to the war-torn country as it tries to fight against Russia. The US president has also disparaged Putin publicly by calling the Russian leader a \"pure thug\" and a \"murderous dictator\".\n###Assistant: (Verse 1)\nRussia ke chatron ke liye ek textbook laya gaya hai,\nJismein likha gaya hai ki Donald Trump ne 2020 ke chunav nahi jeete the,\nYeh kehte hain ki voter fraud ki wajah se Democrats ne ki thi.\n\n(Chorus)\nHistory book mein yeh content hai,\nJo 11th grade ke students padh rahe hain, social media par yeh baat saamne aayi hai.\nMarc Bennetts, The Times (UK) ke foreign correspondent ne X account par post kiya,\nTextbook se ek page ka translation kiya, jismein likha tha ki Trump ne haar mani \"Democratic Party ki saaf chunavi dhokhadhadi ke parinamswarup.\"\n\n(Verse 2)\nTrump, apne sahayogiyo ke saath, ke khilaf jurm ka saamna kar rahe hain,\nUnhe aarop hai ki unhone 2020 ke chunav ke natijo mein hastakshep kiya.\nWahi, Trump ke dawayen ki chunav mein dhokha ho gaya tha, woh kaafi jagahon mein vyapak roop se khadi ki gayi hai.\n\n(Chorus)\nTrump ko bhi aarop lag chuke hain Putin ko tarif karne ke liye,\nJabki woh ne Ukraine mein hamle ko ninda ki hai.\nKuch Russian analysts ke mutabiq, Kremlin ko lagta hai ki 2024 mein Trump ko Biden se adhik pasand kiya jayega.\n\n(Verse 3)\nUniversity of Chicago ke professor Konstantin Sonin,\nNe is Russian textbook ke dawayon par baat ki,\nNewsweek ke saath usne keh diya ki usne is content ki satyata mein shaq nahi kiya,\nAur is kitab ka prakashan is saal ke pehle hi press conference mein kiya gaya tha, jab iski ghoshna ki gayi thi kitab ke lekhakon aur Russia ke Shiksha Mantri Sergei Kravstov ne.\n\n(Chorus)\nTextbook mein aur bhi kuch aise dawayen hain jo sabit nahi hain,\nJismein se ek excerpt Bennetts ne X par share kiya,\nJismein Biden ke tasveer thi, jo mask pehn kar thi, jo sardi-jukam ko rokne ke liye banaya gaya tha.\n\n(Outro)\nBennetts ke mutabiq, yeh excerpt President Biden ke baare mein kuch asabit dawayen thi,\n\"Ek (mask pehene) Biden ke baare mein, jise ek Russian school textbook se liya gaya hai 'Unki poora rajneetik kariye mein bhrashtachar ke scandals ke saath gaya hai.

{"text": "###Human: New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has heaped praise on wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul’s magnificent century against South Africa in Centurian, calling it a historic knock that nobody will forget.\n\nRahul scored 101 runs to help India post 245 runs in the first innings against South Africa in the first Test of the two-match series at SuperSport Park in Centurion.\n\nThe second day witnessed an extraordinary performance that etched Rahul's name in the annals of Indian cricket history.\n\nHaving concluded Day 1 with a gritty 70 off 105 deliveries, Rahul returned to the crease with a determination that echoed beyond the boundary ropes. His blade, an artist's brush, painted a masterpiece on the canvas of Centurion as he not only secured his second century in this South African fortress but also steered India to a commendable total in the first innings.\n\nKaif, acknowledging the challenges of batting at number 6, lauded Rahul's historic knock, expressing that it's no small feat to notch up a century from that position. Rahul's innings of 101 runs off 137 deliveries, adorned with 14 boundaries and four sixes.\n\n“It's not easy to hit a century at No.6. Very difficult conditions, overcast conditions. It was a wet pitch, the ball was moving around. India were in a spot of bother. But KL Rahul stood there. What an innings. It's a historic knock. Nobody will be able to forget,” said Kaif in a video posted on ‘X’.\n\nInterestingly, the innings catapulted Rahul into an elite club, making him the third Indian batter to score multiple Test centuries in South Africa. He shared this prestigious honour with the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who achieved this five times, and the modern maestro Virat Kohli, who had done it twice.\n\n“Keep your mouth shut and let your bat do the talking, that's what you have done well. The game was slipping away. India were in a lot of trouble. This historic knock had patience, it had class. It was a proper Test knock. Well done, KL Rahul,” Kaif added.\n\nPreviously, in the Boxing Day Test of 2021, Rahul scored a memorable century, amassing 123 runs to guide India to victory against South Africa.###Assistant: (Verse 1)\nMohammad Kaif ne tarif ki hai wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul ki,\nJo ne South Africa ke khilaf Centurion mein kiya tha ek shandar century,\nKaif ne kaha ki yeh ek itihasik inning hai, jo koi nahi bhool payega.\n\n(Chorus)\nRahul ne banaye the 101 runs, aur bhar diya tha Bharat ke liye 245 runs ka scoreboard,\nPehle Test ke pehle din mein SuperSport Park mein khela gaya tha yeh match.\n\n(Verse 2)\nDusre din ki performance ne racha ek anokha kamaal,\nJismein Rahul ne likha apna naam Bharatiya cricket itihas mein,\nDay 1 ko 70 runs banakar chhoda tha field ko,\nLekin Rahul ne wapas aakar dikha diya tha ek alag level ka junoon.\n\n(Chorus)\nUski innings ne banai thi ek mahakavya jise Centurion ki canvas par paint kiya gaya,\nUsne apne doosre century ko nahi banaya hi, balki Bharat ko pehle innings mein ek khubsoorat total tak pahunchaya.\n\n(Verse 3)\nKaif ne number 6 par batting karne ke challenges ko samajh kar ki,\nUsne Rahul ki itihasik inning ko saraha, kah kar,\nKaha ki number 6 par century banana koi mamuli baat nahi hoti,\nAur Rahul ne banaya tha 101 runs, 137 balls mein, jismein the 14 chauke aur chaar chhakke.\n\n(Chorus)\n\"Number 6 par century banana aasan nahi hota.

Koi nahi bhool payega,\" Kaif ne ek video mein kaha.\n\n(Verse 4)\nRahul ki yeh inning ne use ek khaas club mein bhi daal diya,\nJismein woh teesre Bharatiya batter ban gaye the jo South Africa mein multiple Test centuries banane mein kaamyaab hue the,\nSachin Tendulkar aur Virat Kohli ke saath is shaandaar samman ko share karte hue.\n\n(Chorus)\n\"Apne muh band rakho aur apni bat ko bolo, yeh wohi hai jo tumne achhe se kiya hai.\nKhel slip ho raha tha.

{"text": "###Human: NEW DELHI: Despite concerns over growing COVID-19 cases in the country, a national survey conducted by LocalCircles has yielded shocking results that 72% of Indians surveyed consider masks a thing of the past. This comes even as recent data from the Union Health Ministry reveals a concerning surge in COVID-19 cases, with the active case tally surpassing 6,500 and six reported deaths. Of particular note is the emergence of JN.1, a new sub-variant of COVID-19, prompting the central government to issue advisories to states to heighten vigilance. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is leading efforts in genome sequencing to understand the characteristics of this new variant.\n\nMask Compliance Declines Despite Advisory\nDespite these alarming developments, a significant shift in public behavior has been observed. A national survey conducted by LocalCircles, receiving over 22,000 responses from 317 districts, indicates that 72% of Indians surveyed consider masks a thing of the past. This revelation comes at a time when health experts emphasize the importance of mask-wearing, especially in crowded spaces and areas with poor ventilation.\n\nHow The Majority Of Indians Responded To The Survey?\nWhen asked about compliance in their respective areas, 72% of respondents asserted that wearing masks is now history, with only 3% reporting adherence to masking norms. The survey highlights a stark disregard for COVID-appropriate behavior, posing a potential risk as cases continue to rise.\n\nNew Year Socialization Plans Amidst Health Concerns\nAs the New Year approaches, the survey delved into citizens' socialization plans. Out of 11,335 respondents, 29% expressed intentions to socialize over New Year's, raising concerns about potential super-spreader events. Notably, 58% plan to stay with immediate family at home, while others consider community gatherings, restaurant outings, New Year parties, or travel.\n\nRisk Perception, Lack Of Caution\nThe survey paints a worrisome picture of the prevailing risk perception among Indians. A mere 3% acknowledging adherence to masking norms indicates a widespread belief that the effort of wearing masks is not justified, despite the ongoing COVID risk. Experts warn that every infection contributes to cumulative immune system damage and increases the risk of long COVID, yet the majority remains unconvinced.\n\nThe current situation mirrors the surge in December 2021 with the Omicron variant. The unknown factor remains the severity of the JN.1 subvariant, particularly its impact on vulnerable populations.
