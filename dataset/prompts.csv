"Karnataka Rakshana Vedika president Narayan Gowda said business establishments should go out of Karnataka if they don't want 60% Kannada in signboards
Members of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedika, a pro-Kannada activist group, were detained on Wednesday after they vandalised some stores in Bengaluru demanding Kannada nameplates to be put up abiding by the guidelines of the civic authority. Several videos of their rampage on Bengaluru streets, in front of Phoenix Mall of Asia, went viral. Karnataka Rakshana Vedika president TN Narayan Gowda said his organisation organised an awareness protest rally about the 60% Kannada on signboard rule which is a government law. Some social media accounts claimed nameplates which had Kannada apart from English were also vandalised.

What is the 60% Kannada rule?
Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has come up with a rule that all commercial establishments will have to put up 60% signage in Kannada. More than half of a signboard should read in Kannada, according to this guideline. A deadline of February 28 has been given, failing which the shops will be closed and their trade licenses cancelled.

'Don't take action before Feb 28': FKCCI
The Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday said the authorities should not take action before the deadline. The federation said it will ask all its members to follow the rule but the government should not take any action against establishments before the deadline. Many establishments were not aware that the 60% Kannada was a BBMP rule and not the demand of some fringe organisations.

'Move to other states if...': Narayan Gowda
Karnataka Rakshana Vedika president TN Narayan Gowda said if establishments do not want Kannada names on their signboards, they should move out of Karnataka. ""People from various states are doing business in Bangalore. But they don't put Kannada nameplates on their shops. They are only putting up the nameplates of their shops in English. If they want to stay back in Bangalore then they have to put nameplates on their shops in Kannada or else they have to move from Karnataka to other states.""

""We told them to put a Kannada nameplate but Mall of Asia (Bangalore) did not bother and has not put a Kannada nameplate so we will fight against this. Today police are providing full protection to the Mall of Asia (Bengaluru), but tomorrow who will provide protection? Tomorrow again our activists will protest, till our demand is fulfilled,"" Narayan Gowda said.

Siddaramaiah warns of action against whoever takes law into hands
After the rampage of the pro-Kannada protestors, chief minister Siddaramaiah said, ""I don't know what they (the protestors) are doing. I have got information that Narayana Gowda is protesting about having Kannada name boards. We will take action against those who took the law into their own hands and went against the law.""

This is not England: Pralhad Joshi amid BJP vs Congress over Bengaluru rampage
While the Karnataka BJP leaders blamed the Congress government for creating the Kannadiga versus non-Kannadiga row in Bengaluru, Union minister and Karnataka MP Pralhad Joshi backed the demand of 60% Kannada and asked why the establishments don't want Kannada signage. ""Everybody should be able to read the signs and not everyone can read English. What is the harm in writing in Kannada as well as in English or another language, like Hindi? This is not England,"" he said.","(Verse 1)

"With Iranian proxies targeting merchant ships off the Indian coast, the Indian Navy has increased surveillance of Arabian Sea.
New Delhi: The Indian Navy has now deployed five frontline guided missile destroyers along with logistics tanker, Boeing P 8 I anti-submarine warfare aircraft and long endurance Sea Guardian drone to keep the sea lanes of communication between Bab el-Mandeb to Indian coast safe for merchant shipping and missile attack by Iranian proxies in the Middle-East.

Indian Navy has deployed five destroyers after MV Chem Puto strike. 
Indian Navy has deployed five destroyers after MV Chem Puto strike.
It is understood that the Indian Navy has deployed INS Kolkata, INS Kochi, INS Mormugao, INS Chennai and INS Visakhapatnam into the Arabian theatre independent of the US led coalition in the Middle-East region. While INS Kolkata is on the mouth of Red Sea, INS Kochi is south of Yemen Socotra Island, INS Mormugao is in west Arabian sea with Chennai in Central Arabian sea.

INS Visakhapatnam was tasked to patrol the north Arabian sea and left the Indian coast two days ago after an Iranian loitering ammunition Shahed 136 hit chemical tanker MV Chem Pluto 210 nautical miles off Dwarka in Gujarat.

The five top of the line destroyers are being fueled by M V Swarnamala, a 25000 ton oil tanker, currently hired by the Indian Navy. The civilian tanker has a massive fuel and lubricant capacity as compared to the Indian Navy’s tankers.

While the Indian ships are dominating the Arabian Sea to prevent black shipping, piracy and deter missile attacks on commercial shipping by Iranian’s axis of resistance militia and terrorist groups, Boeing P 8 I multi-mission aircraft along with long endurance Sea Guardian drone are constantly surveying the vessels in Arabian Sea and up to Gulf of Aden to identify suspicious ships and dhows used for targeting the commercial shipping by the Shia Houthis in Yemen, Shia Kaitab Hezbollah in Iraq and by Tehran. The Iranian proxies, particularly the Houthis, are targeting vessels in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea against Israel’s war against Sunni Hamas terrorist group in Gaza. Iran backed Shia Hezbollah group has also opened a front with Israel on its northern border.

While the US led coalition is deterring the Iranian proxies from attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Indian effort is to help secure the Arabian Sea from any missile attacks on commercial shipping routes emanating from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf with trillion dollar worth of merchant and oil trade at risk from Iranian militia.

To add to the Indian Navy effort, the Coast Guard is also patrolling the EEZ on western coast with offshore patrol vessels and Dornier surveillance aircraft to ensure that there is no suspicious activity on the Indian coast line and Arabian Sea.","(Verse 1)

"The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police has arrested a former senior technical assistant at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for allegedly cheating several people, including professors at JNU and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, of more than Rs 11 crore.

The accused, P D Gaikwad, allegedly cheated people on the pretext of providing affordable housing as part of a project under a purported Delhi Development Authority (DDA)-approved land pooling policy. He was arrested by the EOW on December 14.

As per the first information report (FIR), the complainants, the JNU and IIT Delhi professors, alleged that Gaikwad had formed a group named ‘Noble Socio-Scientific Welfare Organization (NSSWO)’ and claimed to provide affordable housing. He also made a presentation before the victims, enticing them to be a part of the NSSWO, and provided them with fabricated details of the proposed housing project.

The police said the complainants, who became members of NSSWO, ‘booked units’ in the proposed project, and paid ‘membership fees’ and other payments for the apartments.

Gaikwad continued to lie to the victims until November 2015 when the investors began doubting him. He again misled them by showing them a piece of land in Najafgarh, the police said. However, he had no supporting papers or any other such documents

Festive offer
According to police, he allegedly collected more than Rs 11 crore during 2011- 2021 in the name of a proposed housing society and misappropriated the money in the form of cash withdrawals and by transferring it to other people in the name of purchasing land and services rendered by the liaisoner.

'Rs 6,000 Loss': Man Takes Cab To Reach Destination After Train Runs 9 Hours Late
The man had a verified Tatkal ticket.


During holidays and festivals, excessive crowds and train delays are common occurrences. However, it gets worse in winter due to fog and loss of visibility across north India. Several trains are delayed or cancelled. A Kanpur man recently shared his plight on X (formerly Twitter) after his train was delayed by nine hours. He stated that he had no other choice but to hire an interstate taxi from Kanpur to Jhansi to avoid missing his connecting train. Even though he had a verified Tatkal ticket that he purchased for ₹ 1,500, unfortunately, he had to spend ₹ 4,500 for the cab journey to get to his destination on time. 
""The train that I have to take at 1.15 pm at Kanpur arrived 9 hours late. I had to catch Rajdhani at Jhansi at 8.15 pm. So I came to know about (the train being) late at 2 pm. I have no other option other than taking Ola for ₹ 4,500. And the Tatkal ticket was bought for ₹ 1,500. Total ₹ 6,000 loss,"" the user wrote on X on Wednesday. 


Several users also shared their experience with train delays.

“My bua went from Delhi to New York faster than I went from Delhi to West Bengal (train is 16 hours late),” said a user.

Another added, “I am travelling from Nagpur-Hyderabad train number 12724 Telangana express -Hyderabad express. Train was supposed to come in the morning at 7.10 AM but arrived at 3.30 PM. I have my night shift at 8 PM but train is running 9 hrs late, who is responsible for my Loss of pay?”

“Reserved a seat 4 days prior and got a confirmed ticket. It was only after somehow entering the train I realised I couldn't even reach my seat number 64,” he wrote. “After an hour when I reached my seat, I found a pregnant lady sitting on it, so just left and stood at the gate for two hours..

"Google is busy working on its AI model but it seems the company is planning for life with AI for its own business as well. According to a new report, the search giant could lay off as many as 30,000 employees as it gets ready to build use cases for AI to take over from humans.

The report comes via The Information, which says that Google is going to restructure its ad sales department which seems to be seeing the benefits of using AI for its operations. In fact, bringing AI on board could lead to a massive churn at Google, the report suggests. AI is expected to play a big part in the changing revenue stream of digital advertising from the platform, which has a major effect on people being employed to do these tasks.

Google is also testing AI in its customer support service these days which has a direct impact on the human-side of operations at the company. Google has been in the news for handing out pink slips earlier this year as well. The headlines never make for a rosy reading but Google CEO, Sundar Pichai decided to address the need to realign the business and that unfortunately ends up costing people jobs.

At Google, around 12,000 people were already laid off as highlighted in multiple reports. The Google CEO said, “It would have been a major overhang on the company. I think it would have made it very difficult in a year like this with such a big shift in the world to create the capacity to invest in areas.”

There is no doubt that businesses will have to make these decisions, but the need to churn staff to integrate AI will probably face more scrutiny from a company that makes billions across different businesses.

CHANDRAYAAN-3'S GIANT LEAP ON THE MOON
Chandrayaan-3, India's ambitious lunar lander, made headlines worldwide when it successfully reached the south polar region of the Moon in July 2023. The mission, which cost a mere $75 million, not only positioned India as a major player in space exploration but also showcased the country's ability to execute complex space missions economically.

The lander's journey to the Moon was meticulously planned, with its orbit insertion being a testament to the precision and expertise of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The spacecraft achieved an orbit of 164 km x 18074 km, followed by a translunar orbit of 288 km x 369328 km, as intended.

Despite facing challenges, the mission's success was attributed to the relentless efforts of Isro's scientists and their ability to learn from past failures. It landed and conducted experiments on the surface of the Moon.

With the successful mission, India became the first country to land a spacecraft in the Moon's South Pole region.

Chandayaan-3
ADITYA-L1'S RISE TO UNRAVEL THE SUN
Following the lunar feat, Isro's focus shifted toward the Sun with the launch of the Aditya-L1 mission on September 2.

This mission marked a significant milestone in solar research as it captured its first high-energy solar flare using the High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS).

Developed by the Space Astronomy Group at ISRO's UR Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, HEL1OS is designed to monitor high-energy X-ray activity from the Sun. During its initial observation phase, the instrument recorded data consistent with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (NOAA's GOES), confirming the reliability of its findings.

It will reach its destination, Lagrange Point 1, on January 6, 2024.

INDIA JOINS ARTEMIS ACCORDS
India's commitment to international collaboration in space exploration was further solidified with the signing of the Artemis Accords.

By becoming a signatory, India joined a global effort to establish a practical set of principles guiding space exploration cooperation among nations. This move aligns with India's eagerness to participate in lunar exploration missions and work alongside countries like the United States on future Moon missions.

The accords also paved the way for a collaboration between Nasa and Isro to send an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station.

ADVANCING SOLAR TECH
India's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has been making progress in solar cell technology, contributing to the nation's push towards renewable energy sources. Highly efficient solar cell technology using perovskite materials, potentially bringing us closer to affordable and widespread solar energy production.

Additionally, significant progress was made in developing lithium-ion battery technologies with longer lifespans and faster charging times, crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

As we reflect on the year gone by, it is evident that India's scientific community has not only achieved impressive milestones but has also laid the groundwork for future innovations in 2024.","(Verse 1)

"Jaishankar described Russian supplies of energy, coking coal and fertilisers as “very big components” of bilateral trade.
India and Russia on Wednesday agreed to explore ways to expand the export of Russian energy, including oil and coal, to Indian markets as external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Sergey Lavrov charted a course for future cooperation between the two countries.

Jaishankar, who is on a five-day visit to Russia, met Lavrov for a sweeping review of bilateral relations, including cooperation in energy and military-tech, following his talks on Tuesday with deputy prime minister Denis Manturov that largely focused on trade and investment.

Read here: At Jaishankar, Sergey Lavrov meeting, a push to expand export of Russian energy

Despite pressure from the US and its European partners following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India ramped up purchases of Russian energy and other commodities such as fertilisers. The Indian side has consistently called for the end of hostilities in Ukraine but has refrained from publicly criticising Russia’s actions.

Following his talks with Jaishankar, Lavrov described energy cooperation as a “strategic area” of the overall relationship that Russia intends to strengthen. He told a joint news conference: “We agreed on the expansion of the exports of Russian hydrocarbons to the Indian market as well as the cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”

Jaishankar described Russian supplies of energy, coking coal and fertilisers as “very big components” of bilateral trade and said the two sides talked about long-term arrangements for these commodities. “How do we reach long-term arrangements in that regard was a big part of our discussion,” he said.

India has a “very substantial” energy relationship with Russia in terms of investments in Russian oil and gas, “which we are seeking to expand”, Jaishankar said. The two sides are also looking to expand cooperation in nuclear energy. “Yesterday [Tuesday], we signed two important amendments which will take the Kudankulam nuclear power project forward,” he added.

On Tuesday, India and Russia signed agreements to move forward with future units of the Kudankulam nuclear power project in Tamil Nadu, which will have six reactors with a capacity of 1,000 MW each. The first two reactors became operational in 2014 and 2016 and work is underway on two more. Both sides haven’t offered details of the agreements though people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that they are related to the fifth and sixth reactors, construction of which began in 2021.

Despite India’s agreements with the US and France on civil nuclear cooperation, Russia is currently the only country building atomic reactors in India. Lavrov described Russia’s involvement in this sphere as “our practical contribution to India’s activities and work to satisfy its national needs for clean and safe energy”.

The two sides also discussed prospects for cooperation in piloted space programmes, rocket engines, satellite navigation systems and military hardware. Lavrov said Russia is “respectful” of India’s aspiration to diversify its “military and technical links” and is ready to support efforts to produce military equipment under the “Make in India” initiative.

More than 60% of the equipment and weapons systems used by India’s armed forces continue to be of Russian origin, though New Delhi has stepped up efforts in recent years to acquire more Western platforms such as submarines, long-range transport aircraft, and helicopters.

The Ukraine conflict and the situation in Gaza, Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific also figured in the meeting between Jaishankar and Lavrov. India’s position on the issue of Ukraine reflects its “responsible approach towards regional and global issues” based primarily on national interests and the interests of fair international cooperation, Lavrov said.

India and Russia have a shared interest in Eurasia and surrounding waters to seek solutions that “would not provoke any confrontational approaches which are sometimes brought to the region from the outside”, Lavrov said.

The two sides further discussed ways to bolster trade and connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), establishing the Chennai-Vladivostok sea route, and cooperation in exploring the northern polar sea route. They also talked about cooperation in Russia’s Far East and at multilateral forums such as the United Nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping. The Russian side reiterated its support for India’s permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council.

Responding to a question on the Western perception that India’s relationship with Russia is a handicap, Jaishankar said Moscow is a very valued and time-tested partner for New Delhi.

“It’s a relationship from which both India and Russia have benefited enormously. My presence here today and...all the developments I have pointed out, including our growing trade, investments, military-technical cooperation and connectivity projects, I think all of this will give you a good sense of really the importance and the value that we attach to the relationship,” he said.

Lavrov, in his opening remarks, said: “Our cooperation is of a strategic nature, strengthening it corresponds to the national interests of our states [and] the interests of maintaining security in the Eurasian continent.”

Jaishankar’s visit assumed greater significance as India and Russia could not hold their annual leaders’ summit for the second consecutive year. Responding to a question on this issue, Jaishankar said this year’s annual meetings could not be held because of India’s G20 presidency and “certain preoccupations”. He added, “But I’m very confident that we will see an annual summit next year.”

The external affairs minister also reiterated India’s concerns about the imbalance in trade with Russia, which rose to $50 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow further this year because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian energy.

“Today, we appreciated the fact that our trade is at an all-time high. We crossed $50 billion turnover last year. We expect to exceed that this year and what is important is that this trade is more balanced, sustainable and provides for fair market access,” he said.","(Verse 1)

"Though ED has named Vadra in earlier charge sheets related to the case as a close aide of Thampi, this is the first time that Priyanka has been mentioned.
New Delhi Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra bought land in Haryana through a Delhi-based real estate agent who also sold land to NRI businessman CC Thampi, the Enforcement Directorate has claimed, while adding that Vadra and Thampi have a “long and thick” relationship that extends to “common and business interests”.


To be sure, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi have not been named as accused, and the land transactions have been mentioned to draw a link between Thampi and Vadra (PTI)

The larger case involves fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, who is under investigation by multiple agencies for money-laundering, violation of foreign exchange and black money laws, and the Official Secrets Act. He fled India for the UK in 2016. Thampi has been accused of facilitating Bhandari to hide proceeds of crime, along with Sumit Chadha, a British national.

Though ED has named Robert Vadra in earlier charge sheets related to the case as a close aide of Thampi, this is the first time that Priyanka Gandhi has been mentioned in an official document submitted to court.

In the latest charge sheet, filed in November and reviewed by HT on Wednesday, the federal agency has alleged that estate agent HL Pahwa, who sold properties to both Vadra and Thampi, received cash out of the books for the land purchase in Haryana, and that Vadra did not pay the full amount for the sale. Pahwa also sold agricultural land to Priyanka Gandhi in 2006 and bought it back from her in 2010, the agency said.

To be sure, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi have not been named as accused, and the land transactions have been mentioned to draw a link between Thampi and Vadra.

A press release by the agency on Tuesday, which HT reported, also mentioned Vadra in connection with the purchase of a property in London that is part of the probe.Detailing the association between Vadra and Thampi, the charge sheet states, “During the course of investigation in this case, it is found that a long and thick relationship exists between CC Thampi and Robert Vadra. Not only a personal/cordial bond but common and similar business interests are also found between them.”

Thampi, arrested in January 2020, ostensibly told ED that he knew Vadra for over 10 years and that they met several times during Vadra’s visits to the UAE as well as in Delhi. ED has said that Thampi used the services of Pahwa to buy 486 acres of land from 2005 to 2008 in village Amipur in Faridabad, Haryana.

“It is imperative to mention that Robert Vadra also purchased three pieces of land measuring 334 kanals (40.08 acres) in Amipur from [the same] HL Pahwa from 2005-2006 and sold the same land to Pahwa in December 2010. Further, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, wife of Robert Vadra, also purchased agricultural land measuring 40 kanal (5 acres) in village Amipur from Pahwa in April 2006 and sold the same land to Pahwa in February 2010,” the charge sheet said

Pahwa, according to ED, was receiving cash out of the books for the acquisition of land. “It was also noticed that Robert Vadra did not pay the entire sale consideration to Pahwa,” agency has said, while adding that “investigation in this regard is still ongoing”. ED has also provided details of other financial transactions between Vadra and Thampi. For instance, it has claimed, that Thampi purchased a Land Cruiser car from Vadra for which payments were made through cheques from his NRE (non-resident external) account.

About the London property under probe, ED has claimed that Bhandari acquired it in December 2009 and it was renovated using Robert Vadra’s funds. Vadra also stayed in the property -- 12, Bryanston Square -- “three-four times”, ED said. “The common thread with regard to the said (London) property starting from the date of acquisition to its use was CC Thampi, Sumit Chadha and Robert Vadra,” it added.

ED has claimed since 2020 that the property in question, worth 1.9 million pounds at the time, belongs to Vadra, and that Thampi played a crucial role in its purchase.

HT reached out to Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi for comments but did not get a response till the time of going to print, however, earlier inJanuary 2020 he had said:“It’s a free for all in this country…truth has no place. Witch-hunt continues for almost a decade. Another decade more and we will be referring to what happened in 2010, 2011, 2012 and on and on.”","(Verse 1)

"Bulls kept domestic markets on a solid ground with both NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex hitting new all-time highs towards the end of trading session on December 28. This comes on the back of improving global sentiments, wherein traders have rapidly raised bets on interest rate cuts as early as March 2024.

The BSE Sensex clocked record high of 72,484 levels to eventually end 0.5 percent higher at 72,410 levels, while NSE Nifty 50 index breezed past 21,800-mark to end 0.5 percent up at 21,778 levels on December 28. Broader indices, meanwhile, outperformed benchmark indices and gained up to 0.7 percent.

Market watchers continue to flag the broader end of markets with extreme valuations and heightened retail exubrence, calling an incoming correction as 'inevitable' but investors carry on flushing more money in these pockets.

India VIX shoots up amid overbought markets

As a result, an 'overbought' market has shot up India VIX (a measure of investors' perception about risk of sharp swings based on option prices) to 9-month high at 16 levels on December 28.

"Firstcry IPO: Brainbees Solutions, the parent company of online retailer Firstcry, has filed for an initial public offer (IPO), as reported by news agency Reuters. Brainbees Solutions will sell shares worth Rs 1,816 crore ($218 million) and existing investors, including tech-to-tractors firm Mahindra And Mahindra and US private equity fund TPG, will sell up to 54.4 million shares, the IPO papers showed.
The company was valued at $3 billion in April.

FirstCry's biggest shareholder, SoftBank, holds a 25.5 per cent stake in the firm. It had sold shares worth Rs 630 crore ($310 million) in FirstCry earlier this month. The Japanese conglomerate had invested $400 million in FirstCry at an enterprise valuation of $900 million. The extent of shares SoftBank will sell was not immediately clear.
FirstCry, which saw its losses widen six-fold in fiscal 2022-2023 due to rising costs, said it would use funds from the IPO for expanding stores in India and Saudi Arabia, and to clear its leases for existing Indian stores.
The company has a network of 936 stores in India, but has not disclosed its store count in Saudi Arabia.
Companies are rushing to tap investor demand as India's benchmark indices continue rallying to record highs. This has fuelled a rise in IPOs filed in late 2023 in an otherwise dull year for fundraising, and trend could extend into 2024, bankers have said.
Companies have raised funds worth Rs 44,793 crore rupees in main board IPOs so far this year, down 24 per cent from a year ago, as per NSE data.

"New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday announced
the central government's decision to ban the Muslim League Jammu
Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) (MLJK-MA) under the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The Centre accused MLJK-MA of
being involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in Jammu and
Kashmir and supporting terrorist activities.
Announcing the ban, Amit Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi
government's message is loud and clear that anyone acting against the
unity, sovereignty, and integrity of the nation will not be spared and face
the full wrath of the law.
""The Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) is declared
as an 'Unlawful Association' under UAPA. This organisation and its
members are involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in
J&K, supporting terrorist activities and inciting people to establish
Islamic rule in J&K,"" he wrote on 'X'.
Masarat Alam Bhat is known for his anti-India and pro-Pakistan
propaganda. Bhat became the chairman of the hardline faction of the
Hurriyat Conference following the death of Syed Ali Shah Geelani.
Currently, he is incarcerated.
The Union Home Ministry, in a notification, stated that the objectives of
the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) are to attain
freedom for Jammu and Kashmir from India, merge it with Pakistan, and
establish Islamic rule.
The organisation's members have been involved in secessionist
activities, raising funds through various sources, including Pakistan and
its proxy organisations, to support terrorist activities and sustain stonepelting on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir.
The home ministry emphasised that the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir
(Masarat Alam faction) and its members show disrespect towards the
constitutional authority and setup of the country.
28/12/2023, 18:20 Centre bans Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) under UAPA
Their unlawful activities undermine the integrity, sovereignty, security,
and communal harmony of India. Additionally, there have been
indications of the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam
faction) having linkages with banned terrorist organisations.
The outfit and its members have been supporting terrorist activities
with the intent to create terror in the country, thereby endangering its
security and public order.
Their anti-national activities demonstrate disregard and disrespect for
the constitutional authority and sovereignty of India, the ministry said.
The central government believes that immediate action is necessary
against the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) to
curb its unlawful activities, which pose a threat to the territorial
integrity, security, and sovereignty of the country.
The outfit is likely to continue advocating the secession of Jammu and
Kashmir from India, promoting false narratives, and inciting antinational sentiments among the people of the region, which could
disrupt public safety.
Therefore, exercising the powers conferred by the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act, 1967, the Central government has declared the Muslim
League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) as an unlawful
association with immediate effect, the ministry said.
The ban will remain in effect for five years from the date of its
publication in the official gazette unless otherwise ordered.
Bhat has been in jail since 2010 for his alleged involvement in violent
protests in the Kashmir valley.
His release in 2015 became the first impediment in the PDP-BJP alliance
when the then chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed got him released
immediately after taking the oath.
Under pressure from its ally BJP, the then state government had to
rearrest him on charges of sedition and waging war against the state
after allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans at a rally.

Bhat was accused of playing a key role in organising violent protests in
Kashmir in 2010, which resulted in the deaths of over 100 youths.
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance

"A textbook introduced for students in Russia claims that former United States President Donald Trump did not win the 2020 presidential elections due to voter fraud which was committed by the Democrats.   

The images of the content in the history book - which is being reportedly studied by students in the 11th grade - are being circulated on social media platforms in recent days. A page from the book was posted by a foreign correspondent for The Times (UK), Marc Bennetts on his X account and he translated the text in the book which read - Trump lost the election ""as a result of obvious electoral fraud by the Democratic Party.""


Trump, along with his allies, has been facing criminal charges and has been accused of interfering with the 2020 election results in which President Joe Biden emerged victorious. Meanwhile, claims by Trump of the election being rigged have been widely debunked in the courts and other judicial places.

TRENDING NOW

Trump has also faced criticism for complimenting Russian President Vladimir Putin even though he has condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Still, few Russian analysts have said that the Kremlin is likely to prefer Trump over Biden in 2024.

Professor at the University of Chicago, Konstantin Sonin, who has been writing frequently about Russian politics, talked about the claims in Russian textbooks regarding the 2020 election, on X.

Textbook makes unproven claims
Speaking to Newsweek about the textbook, Sonin said that he didn't doubt the content's authenticity and that the publication of the book was announced earlier this year in a press conference by the authors of the book and Russia's Minister of Education Sergei Kravstov. 

Another excerpt from the textbook was shared by Bennetts on X, which included Biden's photograph wearing a mask which was designed to curb the spread of respiratory illnesses.

Watch: Russia-Ukraine war: Russia's defence sector booms amid gains in Ukraine war | Gravitas


As per Bennetts, the excerpt included some unproven claims regarding President Biden. ""On (masked) Biden from the same Russian school textbook 'His entire political career has been accompanied by corruption scandals. He and his family have commercial interests in Ukraine,'"" wrote Bennetts. 


Since the invasion of Ukraine by Putin in February 2022, Biden has been one of the strongest allies of Kyiv and has been pledging more support to the war-torn country as it tries to fight against Russia. The US president has also disparaged Putin publicly by calling the Russian leader a ""pure thug"" and a ""murderous dictator"".
","(Verse 1)
Russia ke chatron ke liye ek textbook laya gaya hai,
Jismein likha gaya hai ki Donald Trump ne 2020 ke chunav nahi jeete the,
Yeh kehte hain ki voter fraud ki wajah se Democrats ne ki thi.

(Chorus)
History book mein yeh content hai,
Jo 11th grade ke students padh rahe hain, social media par yeh baat saamne aayi hai.
Marc Bennetts, The Times (UK) ke foreign correspondent ne X account par post kiya,
Textbook se ek page ka translation kiya, jismein likha tha ki Trump ne haar mani ""Democratic Party ki saaf chunavi dhokhadhadi ke parinamswarup.""

(Verse 2)
Trump, apne sahayogiyo ke saath, ke khilaf jurm ka saamna kar rahe hain,
Unhe aarop hai ki unhone 2020 ke chunav ke natijo mein hastakshep kiya.
Wahi, Trump ke dawayen ki chunav mein dhokha ho gaya tha, woh kaafi jagahon mein vyapak roop se khadi ki gayi hai.

(Chorus)
Trump ko bhi aarop lag chuke hain Putin ko tarif karne ke liye,
Jabki woh ne Ukraine mein hamle ko ninda ki hai.
Kuch Russian analysts ke mutabiq, Kremlin ko lagta hai ki 2024 mein Trump ko Biden se adhik pasand kiya jayega.

(Verse 3)
University of Chicago ke professor Konstantin Sonin,
Ne is Russian textbook ke dawayon par baat ki,
Newsweek ke saath usne keh diya ki usne is content ki satyata mein shaq nahi kiya,
Aur is kitab ka prakashan is saal ke pehle hi press conference mein kiya gaya tha, jab iski ghoshna ki gayi thi kitab ke lekhakon aur Russia ke Shiksha Mantri Sergei Kravstov ne.

Textbook mein aur bhi kuch aise dawayen hain jo sabit nahi hain,
Jismein se ek excerpt Bennetts ne X par share kiya,
Jismein Biden ke tasveer thi, jo mask pehn kar thi, jo sardi-jukam ko rokne ke liye banaya gaya tha.

(Outro)
Bennetts ke mutabiq, yeh excerpt President Biden ke baare mein kuch asabit dawayen thi,
""Ek (mask pehene) Biden ke baare mein, jise ek Russian school textbook se liya gaya hai 'Unki poora rajneetik kariye mein bhrashtachar ke scandals ke saath gaya hai. Unki aur unke pariwar ki Ukraine mein vyapari ruchiyan hain,'"" likha gaya tha."
"New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has heaped praise on wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul’s magnificent century against South Africa in Centurian, calling it a historic knock that nobody will forget.

Rahul scored 101 runs to help India post 245 runs in the first innings against South Africa in the first Test of the two-match series at SuperSport Park in Centurion.

The second day witnessed an extraordinary performance that etched Rahul's name in the annals of Indian cricket history.

Having concluded Day 1 with a gritty 70 off 105 deliveries, Rahul returned to the crease with a determination that echoed beyond the boundary ropes. His blade, an artist's brush, painted a masterpiece on the canvas of Centurion as he not only secured his second century in this South African fortress but also steered India to a commendable total in the first innings.

Kaif, acknowledging the challenges of batting at number 6, lauded Rahul's historic knock, expressing that it's no small feat to notch up a century from that position. Rahul's innings of 101 runs off 137 deliveries, adorned with 14 boundaries and four sixes.

“It's not easy to hit a century at No.6. Very difficult conditions, overcast conditions. It was a wet pitch, the ball was moving around. India were in a spot of bother. But KL Rahul stood there. What an innings. It's a historic knock. Nobody will be able to forget,” said Kaif in a video posted on ‘X’.

Interestingly, the innings catapulted Rahul into an elite club, making him the third Indian batter to score multiple Test centuries in South Africa. He shared this prestigious honour with the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who achieved this five times, and the modern maestro Virat Kohli, who had done it twice.

“Keep your mouth shut and let your bat do the talking, that's what you have done well. The game was slipping away. India were in a lot of trouble. This historic knock had patience, it had class. It was a proper Test knock. Well done, KL Rahul,” Kaif added.

Previously, in the Boxing Day Test of 2021, Rahul scored a memorable century, amassing 123 runs to guide India to victory against South Africa.","(Verse 1)
Mohammad Kaif ne tarif ki hai wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul ki,
Jo ne South Africa ke khilaf Centurion mein kiya tha ek shandar century,
Kaif ne kaha ki yeh ek itihasik inning hai, jo koi nahi bhool payega.

(Chorus)
Rahul ne banaye the 101 runs, aur bhar diya tha Bharat ke liye 245 runs ka scoreboard,
Pehle Test ke pehle din mein SuperSport Park mein khela gaya tha yeh match.

(Verse 2)
Dusre din ki performance ne racha ek anokha kamaal,
Jismein Rahul ne likha apna naam Bharatiya cricket itihas mein,
Day 1 ko 70 runs banakar chhoda tha field ko,
Lekin Rahul ne wapas aakar dikha diya tha ek alag level ka junoon.

(Chorus)
Uski innings ne banai thi ek mahakavya jise Centurion ki canvas par paint kiya gaya,
Usne apne doosre century ko nahi banaya hi, balki Bharat ko pehle innings mein ek khubsoorat total tak pahunchaya.

(Verse 3)
Kaif ne number 6 par batting karne ke challenges ko samajh kar ki,
Usne Rahul ki itihasik inning ko saraha, kah kar,
Kaha ki number 6 par century banana koi mamuli baat nahi hoti,
Aur Rahul ne banaya tha 101 runs, 137 balls mein, jismein the 14 chauke aur chaar chhakke.

(Chorus)
""Number 6 par century banana aasan nahi hota. Bahut mushkil conditions the, mausam me badlaav tha.
Wet pitch thi, ball idhar udhar ho rahi thi. Bharat mushkil mein tha, lekin KL Rahul wahin khada tha. Kya inning thi. Yeh ek itihasik knock hai. Koi nahi bhool payega,"" Kaif ne ek video mein kaha.

(Verse 4)
Rahul ki yeh inning ne use ek khaas club mein bhi daal diya,
Jismein woh teesre Bharatiya batter ban gaye the jo South Africa mein multiple Test centuries banane mein kaamyaab hue the,
Sachin Tendulkar aur Virat Kohli ke saath is shaandaar samman ko share karte hue.

(Chorus)
""Apne muh band rakho aur apni bat ko bolo, yeh wohi hai jo tumne achhe se kiya hai.
Khel slip ho raha tha. Bharat mushkil mein tha. Is itihasik knock mein thi sabr, thi class. Yeh ek sahi Test inning thi. Bahut achha kiya, KL Rahul,"" Kaif ne kaha.

(Outro)
Pehle, 2021 ke Boxing Day Test mein bhi Rahul ne ek yaadgar century banayi thi,
Jismein unhone 123 runs banakar Bharat ko South Africa ke khilaf jeet mein madad ki thi."
"NEW DELHI: Despite concerns over growing COVID-19 cases in the country, a national survey conducted by LocalCircles has yielded shocking results that 72% of Indians surveyed consider masks a thing of the past. This comes even as recent data from the Union Health Ministry reveals a concerning surge in COVID-19 cases, with the active case tally surpassing 6,500 and six reported deaths. Of particular note is the emergence of JN.1, a new sub-variant of COVID-19, prompting the central government to issue advisories to states to heighten vigilance. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is leading efforts in genome sequencing to understand the characteristics of this new variant.

Mask Compliance Declines Despite Advisory
Despite these alarming developments, a significant shift in public behavior has been observed. A national survey conducted by LocalCircles, receiving over 22,000 responses from 317 districts, indicates that 72% of Indians surveyed consider masks a thing of the past. This revelation comes at a time when health experts emphasize the importance of mask-wearing, especially in crowded spaces and areas with poor ventilation.

How The Majority Of Indians Responded To The Survey?
When asked about compliance in their respective areas, 72% of respondents asserted that wearing masks is now history, with only 3% reporting adherence to masking norms. The survey highlights a stark disregard for COVID-appropriate behavior, posing a potential risk as cases continue to rise.

New Year Socialization Plans Amidst Health Concerns
As the New Year approaches, the survey delved into citizens' socialization plans. Out of 11,335 respondents, 29% expressed intentions to socialize over New Year's, raising concerns about potential super-spreader events. Notably, 58% plan to stay with immediate family at home, while others consider community gatherings, restaurant outings, New Year parties, or travel.

Risk Perception, Lack Of Caution
The survey paints a worrisome picture of the prevailing risk perception among Indians. A mere 3% acknowledging adherence to masking norms indicates a widespread belief that the effort of wearing masks is not justified, despite the ongoing COVID risk. Experts warn that every infection contributes to cumulative immune system damage and increases the risk of long COVID, yet the majority remains unconvinced.

The current situation mirrors the surge in December 2021 with the Omicron variant. The unknown factor remains the severity of the JN.1 subvariant, particularly its impact on vulnerable populations. As 29% plan to socialize over New Year's, the need for heightened caution and adherence to preventive measures becomes imperative.

Survey Demographics: Understanding Public Sentiment
The comprehensive survey drew responses from 22,000 citizens across 317 districts, with 67% male and 33% female participants. Geographically, 47% were from tier 1, 31% from tier 2, and 22% from tier 3, 4, and rural districts. Conducted on the LocalCircles platform, all participants were validated citizens registered with LocalCircles, ensuring a representative sample.","(Verse 1)

LocalCircles ke dwara kiye gaye ek rashtriya survey ne diya hairat angez natije,
Jismein 72% logon ka kehna hai ki masks ab ek purani baat hai.

(Chorus)
Yeh sab kuch is baat par hairat angez hai ki,
Haal hi mein Swasthya Mantralaya ke data ke mutabiq COVID-19 ke cases mein tezi se izafa hua hai,
Jismein active cases 6,500 se zyada ho gaye hain aur chhe reported deaths hui hain.
JN.1, ek naye sub-variant ke aane par chinta ka izhar kiya ja raha hai,
Jiski wajah se kendriya sarkar ne rajyon ko chaukanna rehne ki hidayat di hai.

(Chorus)
Is khulasa ne darasal mein dekha gaya hai ki,
Jabki swasthya ke experts crowded jagahon aur kam ventilation wale ilaqon mein mask pehnane ki mahatvaakanksha ko badhava dete hain,
Tab bhi 72% Bharatiya masks ko ab ek itihas ki tarah samajh rahe hain.

(Verse 3)
Jab unse unke kshetra ke anusaar anukoolan ke baare mein poocha gaya,
To 72% respondents ne kaha ki ab masks pehnana ek itihas hai,
Jabki sirf 3% ne bataya ki ve mask norms ka paalan kar rahe hain.
Yeh survey dikhata hai ki COVID-appropriate vyavahar ki taraf ek nazar se dekha ja raha hai, jo ki sankraman badhne par ek potenshial khatra paida kar sakta hai.

(Chorus)
Naye Varsh ke nazdeek, survey ne janata ke samajikaran ke iraadon mein ghuse,
11,335 respondents mein se 29% ne bayan kiya ki ve Naye Varsh mein samajhota karna chahte hain,
Jiski wajah se super-spreader events ke khadshaat ka khatra bana rahega.
Khaas kar 58% log apne ghar par turant parivar ke saath rehne ka iraada kar rahe hain,
Jabki doosre log samudaayik ikhatta, restaurant outings, Naye Varsh ke parties ya phir yatra ka vichar kar rahe hain.

(Verse 4)
Survey ne Bharatiyon ke beech maujood risk perception ka ek chinta janak chitra paint kiya hai.
Sirf 3% logon ka manna hai ki mask norms ka palan karna abhi bhi mahatva purna hai,
Jo sankraman ka khatra badhne par bhi bahut se logon mein is baat ko lekar shaq paida karta hai.
Chikitsa gyaan ke anusaar, har sankraman sanjivani tantra ko nuksan pahunchata hai aur lambi avadhi tak chikitsa mein izafa karta hai, lekin adhikansh log is baat se asantusht hain.

(Outro)
Vartaman sthiti 2021 ke December ke surge ko mirror karti hai jab Omicron variant aaya tha.
Abhi tak JN.1 subvariant ki gambhirta ka anjaam nahi pata chala hai, khaas kar uske asar ko, khaaskar uske asar ko kamzor logon par.
Jab 29% log Naye Varsh mein samajhota karna chahte hain, to nivaran upayon aur roktham upayon ka badhaya gaya savdhani se palan karna zaroori hai.
