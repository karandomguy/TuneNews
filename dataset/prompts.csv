"Karnataka Rakshana Vedika president Narayan Gowda said business establishments should go out of Karnataka if they don't want 60% Kannada in signboards
Members of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedika, a pro-Kannada activist group, were detained on Wednesday after they vandalised some stores in Bengaluru demanding Kannada nameplates to be put up abiding by the guidelines of the civic authority. Several videos of their rampage on Bengaluru streets, in front of Phoenix Mall of Asia, went viral. Karnataka Rakshana Vedika president TN Narayan Gowda said his organisation organised an awareness protest rally about the 60% Kannada on signboard rule which is a government law. Some social media accounts claimed nameplates which had Kannada apart from English were also vandalised.

What is the 60% Kannada rule?
Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has come up with a rule that all commercial establishments will have to put up 60% signage in Kannada. More than half of a signboard should read in Kannada, according to this guideline. A deadline of February 28 has been given, failing which the shops will be closed and their trade licenses cancelled.

'Don't take action before Feb 28': FKCCI
The Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday said the authorities should not take action before the deadline. The federation said it will ask all its members to follow the rule but the government should not take any action against establishments before the deadline. Many establishments were not aware that the 60% Kannada was a BBMP rule and not the demand of some fringe organisations.

'Move to other states if...': Narayan Gowda
Karnataka Rakshana Vedika president TN Narayan Gowda said if establishments do not want Kannada names on their signboards, they should move out of Karnataka. ""People from various states are doing business in Bangalore. But they don't put Kannada nameplates on their shops. They are only putting up the nameplates of their shops in English. If they want to stay back in Bangalore then they have to put nameplates on their shops in Kannada or else they have to move from Karnataka to other states.""

""We told them to put a Kannada nameplate but Mall of Asia (Bangalore) did not bother and has not put a Kannada nameplate so we will fight against this. Today police are providing full protection to the Mall of Asia (Bengaluru), but tomorrow who will provide protection? Tomorrow again our activists will protest, till our demand is fulfilled,"" Narayan Gowda said.

Siddaramaiah warns of action against whoever takes law into hands
After the rampage of the pro-Kannada protestors, chief minister Siddaramaiah said, ""I don't know what they (the protestors) are doing. I have got information that Narayana Gowda is protesting about having Kannada name boards. We will take action against those who took the law into their own hands and went against the law.""

This is not England: Pralhad Joshi amid BJP vs Congress over Bengaluru rampage
While the Karnataka BJP leaders blamed the Congress government for creating the Kannadiga versus non-Kannadiga row in Bengaluru, Union minister and Karnataka MP Pralhad Joshi backed the demand of 60% Kannada and asked why the establishments don't want Kannada signage. ""Everybody should be able to read the signs and not everyone can read English. What is the harm in writing in Kannada as well as in English or another language, like Hindi? This is not England,"" he said.","(Verse 1)

"With Iranian proxies targeting merchant ships off the Indian coast, the Indian Navy has increased surveillance of Arabian Sea.
New Delhi: The Indian Navy has now deployed five frontline guided missile destroyers along with logistics tanker, Boeing P 8 I anti-submarine warfare aircraft and long endurance Sea Guardian drone to keep the sea lanes of communication between Bab el-Mandeb to Indian coast safe for merchant shipping and missile attack by Iranian proxies in the Middle-East.

Indian Navy has deployed five destroyers after MV Chem Puto strike. 
Indian Navy has deployed five destroyers after MV Chem Puto strike.
It is understood that the Indian Navy has deployed INS Kolkata, INS Kochi, INS Mormugao, INS Chennai and INS Visakhapatnam into the Arabian theatre independent of the US led coalition in the Middle-East region. While INS Kolkata is on the mouth of Red Sea, INS Kochi is south of Yemen Socotra Island, INS Mormugao is in west Arabian sea with Chennai in Central Arabian sea.

INS Visakhapatnam was tasked to patrol the north Arabian sea and left the Indian coast two days ago after an Iranian loitering ammunition Shahed 136 hit chemical tanker MV Chem Pluto 210 nautical miles off Dwarka in Gujarat.

The five top of the line destroyers are being fueled by M V Swarnamala, a 25000 ton oil tanker, currently hired by the Indian Navy. The civilian tanker has a massive fuel and lubricant capacity as compared to the Indian Navy’s tankers.

While the Indian ships are dominating the Arabian Sea to prevent black shipping, piracy and deter missile attacks on commercial shipping by Iranian’s axis of resistance militia and terrorist groups, Boeing P 8 I multi-mission aircraft along with long endurance Sea Guardian drone are constantly surveying the vessels in Arabian Sea and up to Gulf of Aden to identify suspicious ships and dhows used for targeting the commercial shipping by the Shia Houthis in Yemen, Shia Kaitab Hezbollah in Iraq and by Tehran. The Iranian proxies, particularly the Houthis, are targeting vessels in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea against Israel’s war against Sunni Hamas terrorist group in Gaza. Iran backed Shia Hezbollah group has also opened a front with Israel on its northern border.

While the US led coalition is deterring the Iranian proxies from attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Indian effort is to help secure the Arabian Sea from any missile attacks on commercial shipping routes emanating from the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf with trillion dollar worth of merchant and oil trade at risk from Iranian militia.

To add to the Indian Navy effort, the Coast Guard is also patrolling the EEZ on western coast with offshore patrol vessels and Dornier surveillance aircraft to ensure that there is no suspicious activity on the Indian coast line and Arabian Sea.","(Verse 1)

"The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police has arrested a former senior technical assistant at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for allegedly cheating several people, including professors at JNU and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, of more than Rs 11 crore.

The accused, P D Gaikwad, allegedly cheated people on the pretext of providing affordable housing as part of a project under a purported Delhi Development Authority (DDA)-approved land pooling policy. He was arrested by the EOW on December 14.

As per the first information report (FIR), the complainants, the JNU and IIT Delhi professors, alleged that Gaikwad had formed a group named ‘Noble Socio-Scientific Welfare Organization (NSSWO)’ and claimed to provide affordable housing. He also made a presentation before the victims, enticing them to be a part of the NSSWO, and provided them with fabricated details of the proposed housing project.

The police said the complainants, who became members of NSSWO, ‘booked units’ in the proposed project, and paid ‘membership fees’ and other payments for the apartments.

Gaikwad continued to lie to the victims until November 2015 when the investors began doubting him. He again misled them by showing them a piece of land in Najafgarh, the police said. However, he had no supporting papers or any other such documents

Festive offer
According to police, he allegedly collected more than Rs 11 crore during 2011- 2021 in the name of a proposed housing society and misappropriated the money in the form of cash withdrawals and by transferring it to other people in the name of purchasing land and services rendered by the liaisoner.

'Rs 6,000 Loss': Man Takes Cab To Reach Destination After Train Runs 9 Hours Late
The man had a verified Tatkal ticket.


During holidays and festivals, excessive crowds and train delays are common occurrences. However, it gets worse in winter due to fog and loss of visibility across north India. Several trains are delayed or cancelled. A Kanpur man recently shared his plight on X (formerly Twitter) after his train was delayed by nine hours. He stated that he had no other choice but to hire an interstate taxi from Kanpur to Jhansi to avoid missing his connecting train. Even though he had a verified Tatkal ticket that he purchased for ₹ 1,500, unfortunately, he had to spend ₹ 4,500 for the cab journey to get to his destination on time. 
""The train that I have to take at 1.15 pm at Kanpur arrived 9 hours late. I had to catch Rajdhani at Jhansi at 8.15 pm. So I came to know about (the train being) late at 2 pm. I have no other option other than taking Ola for ₹ 4,500. And the Tatkal ticket was bought for ₹ 1,500. Total ₹ 6,000 loss,"" the user wrote on X on Wednesday. 


Several users also shared their experience with train delays.

“My bua went from Delhi to New York faster than I went from Delhi to West Bengal (train is 16 hours late),” said a user.

Another added, “I am travelling from Nagpur-Hyderabad train number 12724 Telangana express -Hyderabad express. Train was supposed to come in the morning at 7.10 AM but arrived at 3.30 PM. I have my night shift at 8 PM but train is running 9 hrs late, who is responsible for my Loss of pay?”

“Reserved a seat 4 days prior and got a confirmed ticket. It was only after somehow entering the train I realised I couldn't even reach my seat number 64,” he wrote. “After an hour when I reached my seat, I found a pregnant lady sitting on it, so just left and stood at the gate for two hours..

"Google is busy working on its AI model but it seems the company is planning for life with AI for its own business as well. According to a new report, the search giant could lay off as many as 30,000 employees as it gets ready to build use cases for AI to take over from humans.

The report comes via The Information, which says that Google is going to restructure its ad sales department which seems to be seeing the benefits of using AI for its operations. In fact, bringing AI on board could lead to a massive churn at Google, the report suggests. AI is expected to play a big part in the changing revenue stream of digital advertising from the platform, which has a major effect on people being employed to do these tasks.

Google is also testing AI in its customer support service these days which has a direct impact on the human-side of operations at the company. Google has been in the news for handing out pink slips earlier this year as well. The headlines never make for a rosy reading but Google CEO, Sundar Pichai decided to address the need to realign the business and that unfortunately ends up costing people jobs.

At Google, around 12,000 people were already laid off as highlighted in multiple reports. The Google CEO said, “It would have been a major overhang on the company. I think it would have made it very difficult in a year like this with such a big shift in the world to create the capacity to invest in areas.”

There is no doubt that businesses will have to make these decisions, but the need to churn staff to integrate AI will probably face more scrutiny from a company that makes billions across different businesses.

CHANDRAYAAN-3'S GIANT LEAP ON THE MOON
Chandrayaan-3, India's ambitious lunar lander, made headlines worldwide when it successfully reached the south polar region of the Moon in July 2023. The mission, which cost a mere $75 million, not only positioned India as a major player in space exploration but also showcased the country's ability to execute complex space missions economically.

The lander's journey to the Moon was meticulously planned, with its orbit insertion being a testament to the precision and expertise of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro). The spacecraft achieved an orbit of 164 km x 18074 km, followed by a translunar orbit of 288 km x 369328 km, as intended.

Despite facing challenges, the mission's success was attributed to the relentless efforts of Isro's scientists and their ability to learn from past failures. It landed and conducted experiments on the surface of the Moon.

With the successful mission, India became the first country to land a spacecraft in the Moon's South Pole region.

Chandayaan-3
ADITYA-L1'S RISE TO UNRAVEL THE SUN
Following the lunar feat, Isro's focus shifted toward the Sun with the launch of the Aditya-L1 mission on September 2.

This mission marked a significant milestone in solar research as it captured its first high-energy solar flare using the High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer (HEL1OS).

Developed by the Space Astronomy Group at ISRO's UR Rao Satellite Centre in Bengaluru, HEL1OS is designed to monitor high-energy X-ray activity from the Sun. During its initial observation phase, the instrument recorded data consistent with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (NOAA's GOES), confirming the reliability of its findings.

It will reach its destination, Lagrange Point 1, on January 6, 2024.

INDIA JOINS ARTEMIS ACCORDS
India's commitment to international collaboration in space exploration was further solidified with the signing of the Artemis Accords.

By becoming a signatory, India joined a global effort to establish a practical set of principles guiding space exploration cooperation among nations. This move aligns with India's eagerness to participate in lunar exploration missions and work alongside countries like the United States on future Moon missions.

The accords also paved the way for a collaboration between Nasa and Isro to send an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station.

ADVANCING SOLAR TECH
India's National Renewable Energy Laboratory has been making progress in solar cell technology, contributing to the nation's push towards renewable energy sources. Highly efficient solar cell technology using perovskite materials, potentially bringing us closer to affordable and widespread solar energy production.

Additionally, significant progress was made in developing lithium-ion battery technologies with longer lifespans and faster charging times, crucial for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

As we reflect on the year gone by, it is evident that India's scientific community has not only achieved impressive milestones but has also laid the groundwork for future innovations in 2024.","(Verse 1)

"Jaishankar described Russian supplies of energy, coking coal and fertilisers as “very big components” of bilateral trade.
India and Russia on Wednesday agreed to explore ways to expand the export of Russian energy, including oil and coal, to Indian markets as external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his counterpart Sergey Lavrov charted a course for future cooperation between the two countries.

Jaishankar, who is on a five-day visit to Russia, met Lavrov for a sweeping review of bilateral relations, including cooperation in energy and military-tech, following his talks on Tuesday with deputy prime minister Denis Manturov that largely focused on trade and investment.

Read here: At Jaishankar, Sergey Lavrov meeting, a push to expand export of Russian energy

Despite pressure from the US and its European partners following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India ramped up purchases of Russian energy and other commodities such as fertilisers. The Indian side has consistently called for the end of hostilities in Ukraine but has refrained from publicly criticising Russia’s actions.

Following his talks with Jaishankar, Lavrov described energy cooperation as a “strategic area” of the overall relationship that Russia intends to strengthen. He told a joint news conference: “We agreed on the expansion of the exports of Russian hydrocarbons to the Indian market as well as the cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.”

Jaishankar described Russian supplies of energy, coking coal and fertilisers as “very big components” of bilateral trade and said the two sides talked about long-term arrangements for these commodities. “How do we reach long-term arrangements in that regard was a big part of our discussion,” he said.

India has a “very substantial” energy relationship with Russia in terms of investments in Russian oil and gas, “which we are seeking to expand”, Jaishankar said. The two sides are also looking to expand cooperation in nuclear energy. “Yesterday [Tuesday], we signed two important amendments which will take the Kudankulam nuclear power project forward,” he added.

On Tuesday, India and Russia signed agreements to move forward with future units of the Kudankulam nuclear power project in Tamil Nadu, which will have six reactors with a capacity of 1,000 MW each. The first two reactors became operational in 2014 and 2016 and work is underway on two more. Both sides haven’t offered details of the agreements though people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity that they are related to the fifth and sixth reactors, construction of which began in 2021.

Despite India’s agreements with the US and France on civil nuclear cooperation, Russia is currently the only country building atomic reactors in India. Lavrov described Russia’s involvement in this sphere as “our practical contribution to India’s activities and work to satisfy its national needs for clean and safe energy”.

The two sides also discussed prospects for cooperation in piloted space programmes, rocket engines, satellite navigation systems and military hardware. Lavrov said Russia is “respectful” of India’s aspiration to diversify its “military and technical links” and is ready to support efforts to produce military equipment under the “Make in India” initiative.

More than 60% of the equipment and weapons systems used by India’s armed forces continue to be of Russian origin, though New Delhi has stepped up efforts in recent years to acquire more Western platforms such as submarines, long-range transport aircraft, and helicopters.

The Ukraine conflict and the situation in Gaza, Afghanistan and the Indo-Pacific also figured in the meeting between Jaishankar and Lavrov. India’s position on the issue of Ukraine reflects its “responsible approach towards regional and global issues” based primarily on national interests and the interests of fair international cooperation, Lavrov said.

India and Russia have a shared interest in Eurasia and surrounding waters to seek solutions that “would not provoke any confrontational approaches which are sometimes brought to the region from the outside”, Lavrov said.

The two sides further discussed ways to bolster trade and connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), establishing the Chennai-Vladivostok sea route, and cooperation in exploring the northern polar sea route. They also talked about cooperation in Russia’s Far East and at multilateral forums such as the United Nations, Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping. The Russian side reiterated its support for India’s permanent membership of a reformed UN Security Council.

Responding to a question on the Western perception that India’s relationship with Russia is a handicap, Jaishankar said Moscow is a very valued and time-tested partner for New Delhi.

“It’s a relationship from which both India and Russia have benefited enormously. My presence here today and...all the developments I have pointed out, including our growing trade, investments, military-technical cooperation and connectivity projects, I think all of this will give you a good sense of really the importance and the value that we attach to the relationship,” he said.

Lavrov, in his opening remarks, said: “Our cooperation is of a strategic nature, strengthening it corresponds to the national interests of our states [and] the interests of maintaining security in the Eurasian continent.”

Jaishankar’s visit assumed greater significance as India and Russia could not hold their annual leaders’ summit for the second consecutive year. Responding to a question on this issue, Jaishankar said this year’s annual meetings could not be held because of India’s G20 presidency and “certain preoccupations”. He added, “But I’m very confident that we will see an annual summit next year.”

The external affairs minister also reiterated India’s concerns about the imbalance in trade with Russia, which rose to $50 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow further this year because of New Delhi’s purchases of Russian energy.

“Today, we appreciated the fact that our trade is at an all-time high. We crossed $50 billion turnover last year. We expect to exceed that this year and what is important is that this trade is more balanced, sustainable and provides for fair market access,” he said.","(Verse 1)

"Though ED has named Vadra in earlier charge sheets related to the case as a close aide of Thampi, this is the first time that Priyanka has been mentioned.
New Delhi Former Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s son-in-law Robert Vadra and daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra bought land in Haryana through a Delhi-based real estate agent who also sold land to NRI businessman CC Thampi, the Enforcement Directorate has claimed, while adding that Vadra and Thampi have a “long and thick” relationship that extends to “common and business interests”.


To be sure, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi have not been named as accused, and the land transactions have been mentioned to draw a link between Thampi and Vadra (PTI)

The larger case involves fugitive arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari, who is under investigation by multiple agencies for money-laundering, violation of foreign exchange and black money laws, and the Official Secrets Act. He fled India for the UK in 2016. Thampi has been accused of facilitating Bhandari to hide proceeds of crime, along with Sumit Chadha, a British national.

Though ED has named Robert Vadra in earlier charge sheets related to the case as a close aide of Thampi, this is the first time that Priyanka Gandhi has been mentioned in an official document submitted to court.

In the latest charge sheet, filed in November and reviewed by HT on Wednesday, the federal agency has alleged that estate agent HL Pahwa, who sold properties to both Vadra and Thampi, received cash out of the books for the land purchase in Haryana, and that Vadra did not pay the full amount for the sale. Pahwa also sold agricultural land to Priyanka Gandhi in 2006 and bought it back from her in 2010, the agency said.

To be sure, Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi have not been named as accused, and the land transactions have been mentioned to draw a link between Thampi and Vadra.

A press release by the agency on Tuesday, which HT reported, also mentioned Vadra in connection with the purchase of a property in London that is part of the probe.Detailing the association between Vadra and Thampi, the charge sheet states, “During the course of investigation in this case, it is found that a long and thick relationship exists between CC Thampi and Robert Vadra. Not only a personal/cordial bond but common and similar business interests are also found between them.”

Thampi, arrested in January 2020, ostensibly told ED that he knew Vadra for over 10 years and that they met several times during Vadra’s visits to the UAE as well as in Delhi. ED has said that Thampi used the services of Pahwa to buy 486 acres of land from 2005 to 2008 in village Amipur in Faridabad, Haryana.

“It is imperative to mention that Robert Vadra also purchased three pieces of land measuring 334 kanals (40.08 acres) in Amipur from [the same] HL Pahwa from 2005-2006 and sold the same land to Pahwa in December 2010. Further, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, wife of Robert Vadra, also purchased agricultural land measuring 40 kanal (5 acres) in village Amipur from Pahwa in April 2006 and sold the same land to Pahwa in February 2010,” the charge sheet said

Pahwa, according to ED, was receiving cash out of the books for the acquisition of land. “It was also noticed that Robert Vadra did not pay the entire sale consideration to Pahwa,” agency has said, while adding that “investigation in this regard is still ongoing”. ED has also provided details of other financial transactions between Vadra and Thampi. For instance, it has claimed, that Thampi purchased a Land Cruiser car from Vadra for which payments were made through cheques from his NRE (non-resident external) account.

About the London property under probe, ED has claimed that Bhandari acquired it in December 2009 and it was renovated using Robert Vadra’s funds. Vadra also stayed in the property -- 12, Bryanston Square -- “three-four times”, ED said. “The common thread with regard to the said (London) property starting from the date of acquisition to its use was CC Thampi, Sumit Chadha and Robert Vadra,” it added.

ED has claimed since 2020 that the property in question, worth 1.9 million pounds at the time, belongs to Vadra, and that Thampi played a crucial role in its purchase.

HT reached out to Robert Vadra and Priyanka Gandhi for comments but did not get a response till the time of going to print, however, earlier inJanuary 2020 he had said:“It’s a free for all in this country…truth has no place. Witch-hunt continues for almost a decade. Another decade more and we will be referring to what happened in 2010, 2011, 2012 and on and on.”","(Verse 1)

"Bulls kept domestic markets on a solid ground with both NSE Nifty and BSE Sensex hitting new all-time highs towards the end of trading session on December 28. This comes on the back of improving global sentiments, wherein traders have rapidly raised bets on interest rate cuts as early as March 2024.

The BSE Sensex clocked record high of 72,484 levels to eventually end 0.5 percent higher at 72,410 levels, while NSE Nifty 50 index breezed past 21,800-mark to end 0.5 percent up at 21,778 levels on December 28. Broader indices, meanwhile, outperformed benchmark indices and gained up to 0.7 percent.

Market watchers continue to flag the broader end of markets with extreme valuations and heightened retail exubrence, calling an incoming correction as 'inevitable' but investors carry on flushing more money in these pockets.

India VIX shoots up amid overbought markets

As a result, an 'overbought' market has shot up India VIX (a measure of investors' perception about risk of sharp swings based on option prices) to 9-month high at 16 levels on December 28.

"Firstcry IPO: Brainbees Solutions, the parent company of online retailer Firstcry, has filed for an initial public offer (IPO), as reported by news agency Reuters. Brainbees Solutions will sell shares worth Rs 1,816 crore ($218 million) and existing investors, including tech-to-tractors firm Mahindra And Mahindra and US private equity fund TPG, will sell up to 54.4 million shares, the IPO papers showed.
The company was valued at $3 billion in April.

FirstCry's biggest shareholder, SoftBank, holds a 25.5 per cent stake in the firm. It had sold shares worth Rs 630 crore ($310 million) in FirstCry earlier this month. The Japanese conglomerate had invested $400 million in FirstCry at an enterprise valuation of $900 million. The extent of shares SoftBank will sell was not immediately clear.
FirstCry, which saw its losses widen six-fold in fiscal 2022-2023 due to rising costs, said it would use funds from the IPO for expanding stores in India and Saudi Arabia, and to clear its leases for existing Indian stores.
The company has a network of 936 stores in India, but has not disclosed its store count in Saudi Arabia.
Companies are rushing to tap investor demand as India's benchmark indices continue rallying to record highs. This has fuelled a rise in IPOs filed in late 2023 in an otherwise dull year for fundraising, and trend could extend into 2024, bankers have said.
Companies have raised funds worth Rs 44,793 crore rupees in main board IPOs so far this year, down 24 per cent from a year ago, as per NSE data.

"New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday announced
the central government's decision to ban the Muslim League Jammu
Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) (MLJK-MA) under the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The Centre accused MLJK-MA of
being involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in Jammu and
Kashmir and supporting terrorist activities.
Announcing the ban, Amit Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi
government's message is loud and clear that anyone acting against the
unity, sovereignty, and integrity of the nation will not be spared and face
the full wrath of the law.
""The Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) is declared
as an 'Unlawful Association' under UAPA. This organisation and its
members are involved in anti-national and secessionist activities in
J&K, supporting terrorist activities and inciting people to establish
Islamic rule in J&K,"" he wrote on 'X'.
Masarat Alam Bhat is known for his anti-India and pro-Pakistan
propaganda. Bhat became the chairman of the hardline faction of the
Hurriyat Conference following the death of Syed Ali Shah Geelani.
Currently, he is incarcerated.
The Union Home Ministry, in a notification, stated that the objectives of
the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) are to attain
freedom for Jammu and Kashmir from India, merge it with Pakistan, and
establish Islamic rule.
The organisation's members have been involved in secessionist
activities, raising funds through various sources, including Pakistan and
its proxy organisations, to support terrorist activities and sustain stonepelting on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir.
The home ministry emphasised that the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir
(Masarat Alam faction) and its members show disrespect towards the
constitutional authority and setup of the country.
28/12/2023, 18:20 Centre bans Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) under UAPA
Their unlawful activities undermine the integrity, sovereignty, security,
and communal harmony of India. Additionally, there have been
indications of the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam
faction) having linkages with banned terrorist organisations.
The outfit and its members have been supporting terrorist activities
with the intent to create terror in the country, thereby endangering its
security and public order.
Their anti-national activities demonstrate disregard and disrespect for
the constitutional authority and sovereignty of India, the ministry said.
The central government believes that immediate action is necessary
against the Muslim League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) to
curb its unlawful activities, which pose a threat to the territorial
integrity, security, and sovereignty of the country.
The outfit is likely to continue advocating the secession of Jammu and
Kashmir from India, promoting false narratives, and inciting antinational sentiments among the people of the region, which could
disrupt public safety.
Therefore, exercising the powers conferred by the Unlawful Activities
(Prevention) Act, 1967, the Central government has declared the Muslim
League Jammu Kashmir (Masarat Alam faction) as an unlawful
association with immediate effect, the ministry said.
The ban will remain in effect for five years from the date of its
publication in the official gazette unless otherwise ordered.
Bhat has been in jail since 2010 for his alleged involvement in violent
protests in the Kashmir valley.
His release in 2015 became the first impediment in the PDP-BJP alliance
when the then chief minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed got him released
immediately after taking the oath.
Under pressure from its ally BJP, the then state government had to
rearrest him on charges of sedition and waging war against the state
after allegedly raising pro-Pakistan slogans at a rally.

Bhat was accused of playing a key role in organising violent protests in

Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the guidance

"A textbook introduced for students in Russia claims that former United States President Donald Trump did not win the 2020 presidential elections due to voter fraud which was committed by the Democrats.   

The images of the content in the history book - which is being reportedly studied by students in the 11th grade - are being circulated on social media platforms in recent days. A page from the book was posted by a foreign correspondent for The Times (UK), Marc Bennetts on his X account and he translated the text in the book which read - Trump lost the election ""as a result of obvious electoral fraud by the Democratic Party.""


Trump, along with his allies, has been facing criminal charges and has been accused of interfering with the 2020 election results in which President Joe Biden emerged victorious. Meanwhile, claims by Trump of the election being rigged have been widely debunked in the courts and other judicial places.

TRENDING NOW

Trump has also faced criticism for complimenting Russian President Vladimir Putin even though he has condemned the invasion of Ukraine. Still, few Russian analysts have said that the Kremlin is likely to prefer Trump over Biden in 2024.

Professor at the University of Chicago, Konstantin Sonin, who has been writing frequently about Russian politics, talked about the claims in Russian textbooks regarding the 2020 election, on X.

Textbook makes unproven claims
Speaking to Newsweek about the textbook, Sonin said that he didn't doubt the content's authenticity and that the publication of the book was announced earlier this year in a press conference by the authors of the book and Russia's Minister of Education Sergei Kravstov. 

Another excerpt from the textbook was shared by Bennetts on X, which included Biden's photograph wearing a mask which was designed to curb the spread of respiratory illnesses.

Watch: Russia-Ukraine war: Russia's defence sector booms amid gains in Ukraine war | Gravitas


As per Bennetts, the excerpt included some unproven claims regarding President Biden. ""On (masked) Biden from the same Russian school textbook 'His entire political career has been accompanied by corruption scandals. He and his family have commercial interests in Ukraine,'"" wrote Bennetts. 


Since the invasion of Ukraine by Putin in February 2022, Biden has been one of the strongest allies of Kyiv and has been pledging more support to the war-torn country as it tries to fight against Russia. The US president has also disparaged Putin publicly by calling the Russian leader a ""pure thug"" and a ""murderous dictator"".
","(Verse 1)
Russia ke chatron ke liye ek textbook laya gaya hai,
Jismein likha gaya hai ki Donald Trump ne 2020 ke chunav nahi jeete the,
Yeh kehte hain ki voter fraud ki wajah se Democrats ne ki thi.

(Chorus)
History book mein yeh content hai,
Jo 11th grade ke students padh rahe hain, social media par yeh baat saamne aayi hai.
Marc Bennetts, The Times (UK) ke foreign correspondent ne X account par post kiya,
Textbook se ek page ka translation kiya, jismein likha tha ki Trump ne haar mani ""Democratic Party ki saaf chunavi dhokhadhadi ke parinamswarup.""

(Verse 2)
Trump, apne sahayogiyo ke saath, ke khilaf jurm ka saamna kar rahe hain,
Unhe aarop hai ki unhone 2020 ke chunav ke natijo mein hastakshep kiya.
Wahi, Trump ke dawayen ki chunav mein dhokha ho gaya tha, woh kaafi jagahon mein vyapak roop se khadi ki gayi hai.

(Chorus)
Trump ko bhi aarop lag chuke hain Putin ko tarif karne ke liye,
Jabki woh ne Ukraine mein hamle ko ninda ki hai.
Kuch Russian analysts ke mutabiq, Kremlin ko lagta hai ki 2024 mein Trump ko Biden se adhik pasand kiya jayega.

(Verse 3)
University of Chicago ke professor Konstantin Sonin,
Ne is Russian textbook ke dawayon par baat ki,
Newsweek ke saath usne keh diya ki usne is content ki satyata mein shaq nahi kiya,
Aur is kitab ka prakashan is saal ke pehle hi press conference mein kiya gaya tha, jab iski ghoshna ki gayi thi kitab ke lekhakon aur Russia ke Shiksha Mantri Sergei Kravstov ne.

Textbook mein aur bhi kuch aise dawayen hain jo sabit nahi hain,
Jismein se ek excerpt Bennetts ne X par share kiya,
Jismein Biden ke tasveer thi, jo mask pehn kar thi, jo sardi-jukam ko rokne ke liye banaya gaya tha.

(Outro)
Bennetts ke mutabiq, yeh excerpt President Biden ke baare mein kuch asabit dawayen thi,
""Ek (mask pehene) Biden ke baare mein, jise ek Russian school textbook se liya gaya hai 'Unki poora rajneetik kariye mein bhrashtachar ke scandals ke saath gaya hai. Unki aur unke pariwar ki Ukraine mein vyapari ruchiyan hain,'"" likha gaya tha."
"New Delhi, Dec 28 (IANS) Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has heaped praise on wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul’s magnificent century against South Africa in Centurian, calling it a historic knock that nobody will forget.

Rahul scored 101 runs to help India post 245 runs in the first innings against South Africa in the first Test of the two-match series at SuperSport Park in Centurion.

The second day witnessed an extraordinary performance that etched Rahul's name in the annals of Indian cricket history.

Having concluded Day 1 with a gritty 70 off 105 deliveries, Rahul returned to the crease with a determination that echoed beyond the boundary ropes. His blade, an artist's brush, painted a masterpiece on the canvas of Centurion as he not only secured his second century in this South African fortress but also steered India to a commendable total in the first innings.

Kaif, acknowledging the challenges of batting at number 6, lauded Rahul's historic knock, expressing that it's no small feat to notch up a century from that position. Rahul's innings of 101 runs off 137 deliveries, adorned with 14 boundaries and four sixes.

“It's not easy to hit a century at No.6. Very difficult conditions, overcast conditions. It was a wet pitch, the ball was moving around. India were in a spot of bother. But KL Rahul stood there. What an innings. It's a historic knock. Nobody will be able to forget,” said Kaif in a video posted on ‘X’.

Interestingly, the innings catapulted Rahul into an elite club, making him the third Indian batter to score multiple Test centuries in South Africa. He shared this prestigious honour with the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who achieved this five times, and the modern maestro Virat Kohli, who had done it twice.

“Keep your mouth shut and let your bat do the talking, that's what you have done well. The game was slipping away. India were in a lot of trouble. This historic knock had patience, it had class. It was a proper Test knock. Well done, KL Rahul,” Kaif added.

Previously, in the Boxing Day Test of 2021, Rahul scored a memorable century, amassing 123 runs to guide India to victory against South Africa.","(Verse 1)
Mohammad Kaif ne tarif ki hai wicket-keeper batter KL Rahul ki,
Jo ne South Africa ke khilaf Centurion mein kiya tha ek shandar century,
Kaif ne kaha ki yeh ek itihasik inning hai, jo koi nahi bhool payega.

(Chorus)
Rahul ne banaye the 101 runs, aur bhar diya tha Bharat ke liye 245 runs ka scoreboard,
Pehle Test ke pehle din mein SuperSport Park mein khela gaya tha yeh match.

(Verse 2)
Dusre din ki performance ne racha ek anokha kamaal,
Jismein Rahul ne likha apna naam Bharatiya cricket itihas mein,
Day 1 ko 70 runs banakar chhoda tha field ko,
Lekin Rahul ne wapas aakar dikha diya tha ek alag level ka junoon.

(Chorus)
Uski innings ne banai thi ek mahakavya jise Centurion ki canvas par paint kiya gaya,
Usne apne doosre century ko nahi banaya hi, balki Bharat ko pehle innings mein ek khubsoorat total tak pahunchaya.

(Verse 3)
Kaif ne number 6 par batting karne ke challenges ko samajh kar ki,
Usne Rahul ki itihasik inning ko saraha, kah kar,
Kaha ki number 6 par century banana koi mamuli baat nahi hoti,
Aur Rahul ne banaya tha 101 runs, 137 balls mein, jismein the 14 chauke aur chaar chhakke.

(Chorus)
""Number 6 par century banana aasan nahi hota. Bahut mushkil conditions the, mausam me badlaav tha.
Wet pitch thi, ball idhar udhar ho rahi thi. Bharat mushkil mein tha, lekin KL Rahul wahin khada tha. Kya inning thi. Yeh ek itihasik knock hai. Koi nahi bhool payega,"" Kaif ne ek video mein kaha.

(Verse 4)
Rahul ki yeh inning ne use ek khaas club mein bhi daal diya,
Jismein woh teesre Bharatiya batter ban gaye the jo South Africa mein multiple Test centuries banane mein kaamyaab hue the,
Sachin Tendulkar aur Virat Kohli ke saath is shaandaar samman ko share karte hue.

(Chorus)
""Apne muh band rakho aur apni bat ko bolo, yeh wohi hai jo tumne achhe se kiya hai.
Khel slip ho raha tha. Bharat mushkil mein tha. Is itihasik knock mein thi sabr, thi class. Yeh ek sahi Test inning thi. Bahut achha kiya, KL Rahul,"" Kaif ne kaha.

(Outro)
Pehle, 2021 ke Boxing Day Test mein bhi Rahul ne ek yaadgar century banayi thi,
Jismein unhone 123 runs banakar Bharat ko South Africa ke khilaf jeet mein madad ki thi."
"NEW DELHI: Despite concerns over growing COVID-19 cases in the country, a national survey conducted by LocalCircles has yielded shocking results that 72% of Indians surveyed consider masks a thing of the past. This comes even as recent data from the Union Health Ministry reveals a concerning surge in COVID-19 cases, with the active case tally surpassing 6,500 and six reported deaths. Of particular note is the emergence of JN.1, a new sub-variant of COVID-19, prompting the central government to issue advisories to states to heighten vigilance. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is leading efforts in genome sequencing to understand the characteristics of this new variant.

Mask Compliance Declines Despite Advisory
Despite these alarming developments, a significant shift in public behavior has been observed. A national survey conducted by LocalCircles, receiving over 22,000 responses from 317 districts, indicates that 72% of Indians surveyed consider masks a thing of the past. This revelation comes at a time when health experts emphasize the importance of mask-wearing, especially in crowded spaces and areas with poor ventilation.

How The Majority Of Indians Responded To The Survey?
When asked about compliance in their respective areas, 72% of respondents asserted that wearing masks is now history, with only 3% reporting adherence to masking norms. The survey highlights a stark disregard for COVID-appropriate behavior, posing a potential risk as cases continue to rise.

New Year Socialization Plans Amidst Health Concerns
As the New Year approaches, the survey delved into citizens' socialization plans. Out of 11,335 respondents, 29% expressed intentions to socialize over New Year's, raising concerns about potential super-spreader events. Notably, 58% plan to stay with immediate family at home, while others consider community gatherings, restaurant outings, New Year parties, or travel.

Risk Perception, Lack Of Caution
The survey paints a worrisome picture of the prevailing risk perception among Indians. A mere 3% acknowledging adherence to masking norms indicates a widespread belief that the effort of wearing masks is not justified, despite the ongoing COVID risk. Experts warn that every infection contributes to cumulative immune system damage and increases the risk of long COVID, yet the majority remains unconvinced.

The current situation mirrors the surge in December 2021 with the Omicron variant. The unknown factor remains the severity of the JN.1 subvariant, particularly its impact on vulnerable populations. As 29% plan to socialize over New Year's, the need for heightened caution and adherence to preventive measures becomes imperative.

Survey Demographics: Understanding Public Sentiment
The comprehensive survey drew responses from 22,000 citizens across 317 districts, with 67% male and 33% female participants. Geographically, 47% were from tier 1, 31% from tier 2, and 22% from tier 3, 4, and rural districts. Conducted on the LocalCircles platform, all participants were validated citizens registered with LocalCircles, ensuring a representative sample.","(Verse 1)

LocalCircles ke dwara kiye gaye ek rashtriya survey ne diya hairat angez natije,

(Chorus)
Yeh sab kuch is baat par hairat angez hai ki,
Haal hi mein Swasthya Mantralaya ke data ke mutabiq COVID-19 ke cases mein tezi se izafa hua hai,
Jismein active cases 6,500 se zyada ho gaye hain aur chhe reported deaths hui hain.
JN.1, ek naye sub-variant ke aane par chinta ka izhar kiya ja raha hai,
Jiski wajah se kendriya sarkar ne rajyon ko chaukanna rehne ki hidayat di hai.

(Chorus)
Is khulasa ne darasal mein dekha gaya hai ki,
Jabki swasthya ke experts crowded jagahon aur kam ventilation wale ilaqon mein mask pehnane ki mahatvaakanksha ko badhava dete hain,
Tab bhi 72% Bharatiya masks ko ab ek itihas ki tarah samajh rahe hain.

(Verse 3)
Jab unse unke kshetra ke anusaar anukoolan ke baare mein poocha gaya,
To 72% respondents ne kaha ki ab masks pehnana ek itihas hai,
Jabki sirf 3% ne bataya ki ve mask norms ka paalan kar rahe hain.
Yeh survey dikhata hai ki COVID-appropriate vyavahar ki taraf ek nazar se dekha ja raha hai, jo ki sankraman badhne par ek potenshial khatra paida kar sakta hai.

(Chorus)
Naye Varsh ke nazdeek, survey ne janata ke samajikaran ke iraadon mein ghuse,
11,335 respondents mein se 29% ne bayan kiya ki ve Naye Varsh mein samajhota karna chahte hain,
Jiski wajah se super-spreader events ke khadshaat ka khatra bana rahega.
Khaas kar 58% log apne ghar par turant parivar ke saath rehne ka iraada kar rahe hain,
Jabki doosre log samudaayik ikhatta, restaurant outings, Naye Varsh ke parties ya phir yatra ka vichar kar rahe hain.

(Verse 4)
Survey ne Bharatiyon ke beech maujood risk perception ka ek chinta janak chitra paint kiya hai.
Sirf 3% logon ka manna hai ki mask norms ka palan karna abhi bhi mahatva purna hai,
Jo sankraman ka khatra badhne par bhi bahut se logon mein is baat ko lekar shaq paida karta hai.
Chikitsa gyaan ke anusaar, har sankraman sanjivani tantra ko nuksan pahunchata hai aur lambi avadhi tak chikitsa mein izafa karta hai, lekin adhikansh log is baat se asantusht hain.

(Outro)
Vartaman sthiti 2021 ke December ke surge ko mirror karti hai jab Omicron variant aaya tha.
Abhi tak JN.1 subvariant ki gambhirta ka anjaam nahi pata chala hai, khaas kar uske asar ko, khaaskar uske asar ko kamzor logon par.
Jab 29% log Naye Varsh mein samajhota karna chahte hain, to nivaran upayon aur roktham upayon ka badhaya gaya savdhani se palan karna zaroori hai.

In a long post on X (formerly Twitter), Kamath stated that their father was, in a way, their venture capitalist (VC), and the ‘first customer whenever we attempted something.'

‘Gave me the initial seed capital…’
Nithin recalled instances when their father was his first customer: when the former did multi-level marketing, and when he opened a sub-brokerage and portfolio management business, adding that the latter gave the initial seed capital when he (Nithin) decided to trade.

“He supported us in anything that we tried, no matter how foolish it seemed in hindsight. All of this with the limited resources he had access to,” the Zerodha CEO wrote.

‘…invited to speak at Canara Bank’
The entrepreneur then mentioned one of the 'most emotional moments in my professional journey – being invited to speak at Canara Bank, where their father spent his entire career, retiring around 2013.

“He was in the audience and in tears when I gave the talk…gave his whole life to the bank helped many small businessmen without any expectations. He embodied the traditional Indian middle-class values that hopefully we both can stick with throughout our lives, even when he is no longer with us to guide us,” Kamath added.

Zerodha
Established on August 15, 2010, the company was named ‘Zerodha,’ a combination of ‘Zero’ and ‘Rodha’ (Sanskrit for barrier) and is based in Bengaluru. It is a retail stockbroker; it claims that 'more than 1 crore clients place millions of orders every day through our platforms,’ contributing over 15% of all Indian retail trading volumes.","Verse 1:

"Islamabad: Pakistan has received India's request for extradition of 26/11 attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said on Friday. But she said that no bilateral extradition treaty exists between India and Pakistan.
In a statement, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said, ""Pakistan has received a request from the Indian authorities, seeking extradition of Hafiz Saeed in a so-called money laundering case.""

""It is pertinent to note that no bilateral extradition treaty exists between Pakistan and India,"" she added.

Earlier in the day, Ministry of External Affairs official spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said India has conveyed a request to the Pakistan government regarding the extradition of Hafiz Saeed to India for facing trial in a particular case.

Addressing the weekly briefing, Mr Bagchi said, ""The person in question (Hafiz Saeed) is wanted in numerous cases in India. He is also a UN-proscribed terrorist. In this regard, we have conveyed a request along with relevant supporting documents, to the government of Pakistan to extradite him to India to face trial in a particular case.

""We have been flagging the issue of activities that he's been wanted for. This is a recent request,"" he added.

Notably, Saeed, who is a UN-proscribed terrorist is the founder of terror outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). He was the mastermind of the deadly 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and is wanted in India in numerous cases.

Muhammad Hafiz Saeed, who has been in jail since July 17, 2019, for other charges, was sentenced in April 2022 by a special anti-terrorism court in Lahore, Pakistan, to a jail term of 33 years for ""financing terrorism.""

Despite being designated a terrorist by the UN and EU in the 2000s, Saeed was neither charged nor extradited over nearly two decades. Saeed was designated as a terrorist by the United Nations Security Council in December 2008.

Meanwhile, in a development that has brought criticism, the Pakistan Markazi Muslim League (PMML), a political entity of Hafiz Saeed has fielded candidates for each and every national and provincial assembly constituency across Pakistan for the upcoming general elections slated to be held on February 8, 2024.

Hafiz Saeed's son Talha Saeed is also going to contest the polls from National Assembly's constituency NA-127, Lahore, Dawn reported. PMML's central president Khalid Masood Sindhu is contesting elections from NA-130, against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz supremo Nawaz Sharif.

"The pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) on Friday signed a peace accord with the central and Assam governments agreeing to shun violence and join the mainstream.

The agreement, signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, came after 12 years of unconditional negotiations between the ULFA faction led by Arabinda Rajkhowa and the government, officials said.

The peace pact is expected to end decades old insurgency in Assam.

However, the hardline faction of the ULFA headed by Paresh Baruah is not part of the agreement. Baruah is believed to be residing at a place along the China-Myanmar border.

The ULFA was formed in 1979 with the demand for a ""sovereign Assam"". Since then, it has been involved in subversive activities that led to the central government declaring it a banned outfit in 1990.

The Rajkhowa faction joined peace talks with the government on September 3, 2011, after an agreement for Suspension of Operations (SoO) was signed between it and central and state governments.","Verse 1:

"Jujutsu Kaisen fans are in for a wild ride as the latest chapter unfolds, revealing Gege Akutami's apparent dislike for the iconic character Gojo Satoru. In a surprising turn of events, Sukuna, the King of Curses, mocks Gojo by mimicking his powerful move.

Gege Akutami's latest Jujutsu Kaisen chapter reveals apparent dislike for Gojo Satoru.(Gege Akutami, MAPPA)
The backstory of Akutami's discontent with Gojo Satoru:
Gege Akutami's discomfort with Gojo Satoru stems from the character's overpowering presence, hindering the natural progression of the story.

Wrap up the year gone by & gear up for 2024 with HT! Click here
The decision to bestow too much power upon Gojo created challenges in introducing new credible threats, leading to Akutami's growing animosity towards their own creation.

Sukuna's mockery in Jujutsu Kaisen manga chapter 247:
In the latest chapter, Sukuna, in a battle with Yuji and sorcerer Higuruma, executes a move resembling Gojo's Limitless: Hollow Purple. The move, Scale of the Dragon Recoil Twin Meteors, seems like a deliberate mimicry, emphasising Akutami's subtle disdain for Gojo. Imagine the most powerful sorcerer (Gojo Satoru) being killed by the king of curses (Sukuna) and then the same curse using Satoru's techniques against his beloved students. It was blasphemous!

Akutami's indirect mockery of Gojo Satoru:
While Akutami has not explicitly admitted to disliking Gojo, their actions, including indirect mocking and offensive tweets, suggest a strained relationship with the character. Akutami's use of Sukuna to mock Gojo only proved the narrative.

Also Read | From Demon Slayer to Jujutsu Kaisen - Here's the list of top 10 anime of 2023 and a few honourable mentions
Gojo's god complex and Akutami's critique:
Akutami's frustration may be linked to Gojo's perceived ""God Complex,"" where the character's overwhelming power disrupted the balance of the Jujutsu Kaisen world. Despite the animosity, Akutami has worked diligently to create an in-depth character in Gojo as any real artist would do.

Jujutsu Kaisen manga chapter 248 speculations and spoiler expectations:

"New Delhi: The weather department on Friday issued a ""cold-day"" alert and said ""dense to very dense fog"" is likely to be witnessed in Delhi-NCR for the next two days.
The maximum temperature of the national capital settled at 19.8 degrees Celsius on Friday, a notch below the season's average.

Trains and flights are operational, but transportation was impacted due to dense fog in the city.

"The Indian government's decision to block URLs of nine offshore exchanges and issue them show cause notices on Thursday came after an official request asking for the same from the Indian crypto and Web3 association's advocacy body, a letter viewed by CoinDesk shows.
The letter dated Dec. 16 was written by the Bharat Web3 Association's (BWA) Chairman, Dilip Chenoy, and was addressed to the Indian Finance Ministry's Department of Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra.
The offshore exchanges have been given two weeks to respond to the show cause notice, which asks why actions against them shouldn't be taken, according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity given the person wasn't authorized to speak on the matter. However, the letter from the BWA sought a one-month grace period for offshore exchanges to register with India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), which falls under the Finance Ministry.
It wasn't immediately clear whether the BWA letter was single-handedly responsible for the action or whether the government would have taken the action unilaterally as well.
In March, India’s Finance Ministry mandated that crypto businesses will have to register with the FIU, the country's anti-money laundering unit, and comply with other processes under its Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). As many as 31 domestic entities have registered themselves with the FIU since.
Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global and Bitfinex are the nine exchanges. None of the entities responded to CoinDesk's requests for comment during the end-of-the-year holiday season.
The BWA didn't immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.
The action by local crypto-related entities against foreign exchanges is rare if not entirely unprecedented in so far as local exchanges haven't asked the government to take action against offshore exchanges. The move comes after Indian crypto exchanges have been in survival mode, trying to extend their runways, ever since the nation imposed stifling taxes on the industry – a 30% tax on crypto profits and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on all transactions.
A think tank has detailed how the TDS prompted as many as 5 million Indian crypto traders to move their transactions offshore and estimated that it cost the government a potential $420 million in revenue since it was introduced in July 2022. The study also revealed that Indians moved more than $3.8 billion in trading volume from local to international crypto exchanges after the controversial crypto rules were announced.
The letter from the BWA also asked for the government to ask the offshore exchanges to establish an Indian subsidiary or entity, to mandate depositing of the applicable TDS effective from when it was imposed on July 1, 2022, and in case of non-compliance, restrict access to these platforms on mobile app stores and block their IP addresses.
It isn't clear whether all of these requests from the BWA feature in the show cause notices.
Crucially, the letter asked the government to give Indian retailers 30 days to withdraw their assets before implementing any restrictions.
""All we are asking for is a level playing field,"" said Rajagopal Menon, Vice President of prominent Indian crypto exchange WazirX which has also been embattled in a dispute with Binance over ownership. ""We are focusing on the 1% TDS issue because that is what is affecting our business.""
Sumit Gupta, the co-founder and CEO of CoinDCX, another leading crypto exchange said Indian exchanges, led by BWA, have consistently advocated for a level playing field, particularly in the context of investors migrating to offshore platforms, which are not obligated to implement taxation and 1% TDS.
""FIU IND's recent steps toward offshore Virtual Digital Assets Service Providers (VDA SPs) will mitigate risks, protecting users and investors from potential scams and fostering the development of a secure VDA ecosystem,"" Gupta said.","Verse 1:
Indian government ne kiya block,
Nine offshore exchanges, sabko shock.

One-month grace period, offshore ko dete the rest.

Finance Ministry ke under, hai yeh kuch blast.

Crypto businesses ko register karna hoga, woh tha unka dasta.

Non-compliance pe, block karna tha unka raasta.

"U.Today - In a recent tweet, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez ignited a wave of optimism within the cryptocurrency community by that the upcoming Bitcoin halving, slated for April 2024, may propel the leading digital asset into an extended period of bullish trends.

Following the event, despite notable fluctuations, the price continued to ascend over the subsequent year, reaching $49,504 on May 11, 2021.

As of the latest , the current price of Bitcoin stands at $42,831. While experiencing a marginal 0.22% dip in the last 24 hours, the digital asset has demonstrated an overall positive trend, boasting an 11.89% increase in the last 30 days.

"New Delhi: A tripartite peace deal between the Centre, the Assam government, and the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) has been signed in Delhi, bringing the curtains down on one of the biggest insurgent groups in the northeast region.
The ULFA (Independent) faction led by Paresh Baruah remains opposed to talks.

The peace deal with the oldest insurgent group of Assam aims to address issues such as illegal immigration, land rights for indigenous communities, and a financial package for Assam's development.

Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters in Delhi the Centre will ensure all the reasonable demands by ULFA will be met in a time-bound manner, and ULFA as an organisation will be disbanded.

""We want to assure the ULFA leadership that their trust in the Centre to ensure the success of the peace process will be honoured,"" Mr Shah said, and credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for bringing peace and stability in the northeast.


Mr Shah said the removal of the Armed Forces (Special) Powers Act (AFSPA) from many areas of Assam and other northeast states is proof that insurgency is nearly extinct in the region.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who sat beside Mr Shah, said the peace deal with ULFA will solve the problem of insurgency in the region to a large extent.

Probe Ordered Into Ex ULFA Member's Suicide After Family Alleges Torture
The Modi government has signed many peace deals with insurgent groups in the northeast after they agreed to lay down arms. In November, Manipur's oldest valley-based armed group UNLF also signed a tripartite peace agreement with the Centre and the state government.

Founded on April 7, 1979, in Sivasagar, Assam, ULFA emerged with the objective of establishing an independent sovereign state for the indigenous Assamese people. The group began its armed operations in the late 1980s, led by figures such as Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, and Anup Chetia.

Initially perceived as a group aiding the needy and the poor, the ULFA's tactics soon escalated to armed struggle against the Indian government.

Post a comment
The catalyst for ULFA's branding as a banned terrorist organisation was the killing of Surendra Paul, a prominent tea planter and brother of Lord Swraj Paul, and the subsequent extortion and threats to tea estate owners. These events exerted international pressure on the Indian government, leading to decisive action against ULFA.","Verse 1:
Delhi mein hua ek historic deal,
Centre, Assam government, aur ULFA ke beech mein.
Tripartite peace agreement, sign ho gaya,
Northeast ke ek bade insurgent group ka samapt ho gaya safar.

ULFA (Independent) faction, Paresh Baruah ke saath,
Talks ke liye nahi, hai woh sath.
Peace deal ka maqsad hai, solve karna issues ko,
Illegal immigration, land rights, aur Assam ke development ka ek roop.

Chorus:
Home Minister Amit Shah ne kaha,
Centre karega meet, ULFA ke reasonable demands ka samaan.
Time-bound manner mein hoga, sab kuch solve,
ULFA ko disbanded karenge, peace process ka resolution evolve.

Verse 2:
""ULFA leadership ko kehna chahte hain hum,
Centre pe trust rakhne ka, hoga inka kaam.""

Paresh Baruah, Arabinda Rajkhowa, aur Anup Chetia ke saath.
Initially perceived as aid for the needy and the poor,
Tactics escalated to armed struggle, against Indian government's door.

Chorus:
ULFA ko ban kiya gaya terrorist organization,
Surendra Paul ki killing, ek prominent tea planter ka assassination.
Brother of Lord Swraj Paul, tha unka connection,
Tea estate owners ko diya extortion aur threats, resulting in international action.

ULFA ki journey, hai ek pivotal moment,

Peace deal ka announcement, hai ek shanti yatra,

"Nepal's former national cricket team captain Sandeep Lamichhane was on Friday convicted by a court of raping a minor. In January, Nepal court released Lamichhane who was arrested after a 17-year-old girl alleged that he raped her in a hotel room in Kathmandu in August last year. Lamichhane, 23, is Nepal's most high-profile cricketer, and the first cricketer from Nepal to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) when he made his debut for the Delhi Capitals franchise in 2018. A single bench of Judge Shishir Raj Dhakal passed the order on Friday following the conclusion of the final hearings that started on Sunday, the Kathmandu Post reported. The Kathmandu District Court on Friday convicted Lamichhane of rape. The next hearing will determine the jail term for the senior member of the national team, the report said.

Lamichhne is currently out on bail. On January 12, the Patan High Court ordered the release of the cricketer. Responding to a review petition filed by Lamichhane, a joint bench of judges Dhruva Raj Nanda and Ramesh Dahal ordered Lamichhane's release on a bail bond of Rs 2 million with conditions.

The Kathmandu District Court on November 4, 2022, had passed the order to send Lamichhane to the Sundhara-based central jail after a detention hearing. Lamichhane had moved the high court challenging the order.

The Kathmandu District Attorney's Office filed a case against Lamichhane accusing him of raping the girl on August 21.

The minor had filed a case against the cricketer on September 6 at the Metropolitan Police Circle, Gaushala.

Nepal Police arrested him on October 6 at Tribhuvan International Airport on his return from Trinidad & Tobago where he played in the Caribbean Premier League.

Through the charge sheet, the district attorney had demanded compensation from Lamichhane for the victim's alleged physical and mental torture. After the charge sheet was filed, Lamichhane's bank account and property were frozen.

A wily leg-spinner, armed with a vicious googly, he was a much sought-after cricketer in other big-ticket T20 leagues around the world, including the Big Bash League (BBL) in Australia, the Pakistan Super League (PSL) and the CPL.

The prodigiously gifted cricketer holds the record for the world's second-fastest bowler to capture 50 ODI wickets and the third-fastest to race to 50 T20I wickets.

Lamichhane's last international appearance came in August this year when he played against Kenya in a T20I encounter.","Verse 1:

"Hyderabad: Raising strong objection against the proposed move to demolish 150-year-old Sunheri Masjid, which is located near the secretariate in New Delhi, Hyderabad MP and All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi has shot a letter to the Chief Architect of New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC).

In the letter, Owaisi has expressing his concerns regarding the demolition of the Sunehri Bagh Masjid at Central Secretariat, days after the urban body issued a public notice seeking Delhi residents’ suggestions or objections on the matter until January 1.  

Owaisi stressed the historical and architectural importance of Sunehri Masjid, and said its removal would constitute an ‘irredeemable loss to India’s heritage’.

“It is not only unfortunate but astounding that the council thinks that a mosque that has been there for nearly past 200 years is an ‘obstruction.’ It is also unfortunate that the council has ignored its own duty to conserve the heritage and beauty of the capital city,” he wrote. 

By choosing to remove a heritage site that is also a place of worship, the NDMC is violating the right of freedom of religion of Muslims under Article 25, he said. “This notification violates Article 25 of the constitution which guarantees freedom of religion which is a fundamental right… It also violates Article 29 which ensures the protection of culture,” he added. 


Owaisi further accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of showing hostility towards Muslims, mosques, and the Azaan. ","Verse 1:
Hyderabad MP, Asaduddin Owaisi,
Letter likha Chief Architect ko, Delhi ki khudaai ke khilaaf si.

Chorus:
Historical aur architectural, Sunehri Masjid ki value ko samjhaaya,
Owaisi ne, NDMC ko likha, concerns batlaaya.

Demolish karke, India ki heritage mein hoga ek bada nuksaan.

Verse 2:
Letter mein kaha, yeh masjid hai almost 200 saal purani,
Hataana ise, hoga ek irredeemable loss, yeh kahani.

Chorus:
Heritage site hataana, jo hai worship place bhi,
NDMC ne violate kiya, Muslims ka freedom of religion ki chi.
Article 25 ke khilaaf, yeh action hai,
Owaisi ne likha, constitution ko yeh hain samjhaai.

Verse 3:
BJP aur Modi ke khilaaf, Owaisi ne kiya aarop,

India was poor in terms of their bowling display as it was just Jasprit Bumrah who was able to ask questions of the Proteas batters. Former Indian coach, Ravi Shastri also commented that the side missed the presence of the experienced pacer, Mohammed Shami who was ruled out due to injury and failed to clear BCCI’s medical Tests ahead of the two-match series.

Avesh Khan who has 38 first-class games under his belt has picked up 149 wickets in his first-class career so far where he represents Madhya Pradesh. He was also the leading wicket-taker during the 2018-19 season where he picked up 35 wickets in just seven games.

"New Delhi: Continuing with its crackdown on human traffickers at the Indo-Bangladesh border,  the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday arrested four more accused involved in illegal infiltration into India via Tripura. Earlier, on November 8, the NIA arrested 29 key operatives following nationwide raids on human trafficking syndicates involved in the case.

Arrests were made in joint operation with Tripura Police
According to the official, the arrests, made in a joint operation with the Tripura Police, were part of the probe into the human trafficking case registered by the federal agency in Guwahati in October.

The agency in a press release said the accused will be brought to Guwahati in Assam after obtaining orders from the court at Tripura's Agartala for their further production before the NIA Special Court in Guwahati.

What NIA investigations revealed?
As per investigations, the accused arrested today were loacted close to the Indo-Bangladesh international border and were linked with the 29 people arrested earlier. ""They had been carrying out human trafficking activities at the behest of racketeers belonging to well-organised syndicates active in several districts of the northeastern state of Tripura. The network of syndicates was further connected to operatives based in other parts of India,"" a spokesperson of the agency said.

The official said investigations have further revealed that the four arrested accused were coordinating with traffickers operating from across the international border to facilitate illegal infiltration of people of Bangladeshi origin into India.

The case was registered by the NIA on October 6 following credible inputs regarding organised human trafficking syndicates operating along the Indo-Bangladesh international border. The NIA had received information about individuals of foreign origin being trafficked illegally to settle them in various parts of India.

""The human trafficking syndicates were found to have linkages with other facilitators and traffickers operating in various parts of the country and across the border. The linkages were identified as part of a larger network engaged in human trafficking activities via the Indo-Bangladesh border,"" it said.

The accused were also arranging forged Indian identity documents for the individuals trafficked from across the border into India, the NIA investigations have further revealed.","Verse 1:
In the heart of the East, by Bangladesh's side,
NIA's crackdown, a relentless stride.
Human traffickers, in shadows they hid,

Four more nabbed, in the trafficking mire.
Linked to syndicates, well-organized and sly,

In Tripura's districts, where they bide.
From Bangladesh they come, with illegal might,

"Personal income and corporate tax collections are likely to rise to more than Rs 19 lakh crore in 10 years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, providing more leeway to come out with people-friendly tax measures. Driven by the increasing income of individuals, net direct tax collections after adjusting for refunds increased from Rs 6.38 lakh crore in FY 2013-14 to Rs 16.61 lakh crore in FY 2022-23.

In the current financial year, the collections from net direct taxes -- person ..

Das saal se chala hai Modi sarkar ka raaj,
Aane wale das saal mein badhegi tax ka daur.

Net direct tax collections badhegi,

"Ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke exclusively to India Today and talked about his management style and how he goes about dealing with tasks associated with challenging sectors.

""Makhan par lakir to sab karte hai. Karni hai to pathar par lakir karo. Kathin hai to kya hua, shuruat to kare (It is easy to draw a line in butter. If you have to, draw a line in stone. It is hard, but let's make a beginning). This is what I believe in, which gives me the conviction to take on difficult and uncomfortable tasks,"" PM Modi said when asked about dealing with difficult sectors such as cleanliness and sanitation.

On being asked about his satisfaction with his performance and the performance of his government in the passing year, PM Modi said that evaluating his journey through a single year may not present the correct picture.

""Evaluating my journey through a single year may not give a correct picture because there is a progressive unfolding of my vision and plans. When I start something, I know the endpoint. But I never announce the final destination or blueprint in the beginning. So, what you see today is not what I've worked on. A far bigger picture will unfold finally. I work on a big canvas. Like an artist, I start from one point, but at the time the final picture can't be seen,"" he said while speaking to the India Today magazine.

PM Modi highlighted that when he presented a plan to construct a 182-feet tall statue of Sardar Vallabhai Patel in Gujarat, people linked it with the 182 seats in the Gujarat Assembly and as an attempt to please a community ahead of elections. However, the site eventually developed into an entire ecosystem of tourism, PM Modi said.

He also added that when the Union government gave its assent to construct the Bharat Mandapam in the national capital, nobody thought that it would serve as the venue of the G20 Summit.

""Take the example of the Statue of Unity (in Gujarat). When I announced that we would build an 182-foot statue, many thought it had to do with 182 seats in the Gujarat Assembly. Some sections thought this was done to please a community ahead of the elections. But see how it has developed into an entire tourism ecosystem, with something for people of all age groups and interests. Just a couple of days back, it saw 80,000 visitors in one day, this is the level of its popularity. I had promised only one thing, but I delivered dozens of things there,"" he said in his interview with the India Today magazine.

""This is my working style. When work on the Bharat Mandapam started, no one thought the G20 would happen here. But I was working with a plan. If I work towards the new Parliament building or 40 million houses for the poor, I do it with equal planning and dedication,"" he added.

'Expert advice, ground connect, India’s lived reality’
In his interview with the India Today magazine, PM Modi also spoke at length about his management and working style while formulating the government's policies.

The PM said that he formulated policies after listening to the economists and subject experts and applying his knowledge gained through the ""ground connect"" and ""lived reality"" of the country.

""My approach to policymaking is slightly different. I listen to all the economists and experts and formulate my policies and strategies through a mix of their advice, my ‘ground connect’ and the ‘lived reality’ of the country. As a result of my ground connection, I have strong convictions. Main kuchh bhi achha lage isliye nahin karta, lekin achha ho isliye karta hoon (I don’t do things because it looks good, I do it because it will do good)"".

PM Modi also added that reforms and policy formulation in his government focus on achieving the optimum utilisation of resources and then motoring the outcomes.

""Growing up in poverty and having had the good fortune of being connected to people at the grassroots gave me an insight into how reforms should focus on improving the lives of the people, and not on mere headlines. It is the result of dozens of such reforms which focused on improving the lives of the people, their ease of living, and their ease of doing business, that India’s growth journey has picked up a rapid pace. We believe in optimum utilisation of resources and outcome-oriented monitoring. We believe in achieving national goals through Jan Andolans (people’s movements)"".","Verse 1:
2024 ke Lok Sabha chunav ke kadam se pehle,
Prime Minister Modi ne kiya bayaan, exclusive India Today ke saath.
Unhone bataya apne management style ko,
Kaise deal karte hain woh challenging sectors ke saath.

Chorus:
""Makhan par lakir to sab karte hai,
Par kathinaiyon ko hum shuru karte hain pathar par lakir banate hain.
Kathin hai, kya hua, shuruat to karni padegi,
Aisa manta hoon main, jo mujhe conviction deta hai, difficult tasks ke liye bhi.""

Verse 2:
2023 mein kiya Modi ne exclusive interview,
Jahan unhone baat ki apne performance aur government ki.
Ek saal ka evaluation sahi picture nahin deta,
Kyunki Modi ka vision hai progressive, ek bada canvas hai yeh.

Chorus:
""Jab main kuch shuru karta hoon, toh main jaanta hoon endpoint.
Lekin main announce nahin karta final destination ko pehle.
Aaj jo dekhte hain, woh hai ek chhota hissa,
Bada picture unfold hoga, jaise artist ka kaam hota hai.""

Verse 3:
Statue of Unity ka example diya Modi ne,
Jab announce kiya 182-foot tall Sardar Patel ka murti,
Logon ne link kiya Gujarat Assembly seats ke saath.
Lekin hua ek poora tourism ecosystem, yeh hai Modi ka style.

Chorus:
""Maine jo ek cheez promise ki, usse maine deliver ki hazaaron cheezein.
Mera working style hai yeh, Bharat Mandapam ki shuruaat se lekar,
G20 Summit ka venue ban gaya. Mera approach hai unique.""

Verse 4:
Expert advice, ground connect, India's lived reality,
Yeh hai Modi ka mantra policy formulation mein.
Unhone kaha, ""Main sunta hoon economists aur experts ko,
Apni policies banata hoon, unke advice, ground connect, aur desh ki reality se.""

Chorus:
""Reforms aur policies mein focus hai resource optimization,
Aur phir monitoring outcomes, yeh hai mera vision.
Jan Andolans ke through hum achieve karte hain national goals,
Yeh hai Modi ka mantra, Jan Bhagidari aur vikas ka role."""

Maine: Top election official blocks Trump from 2024 ballot
Maine has become the second state to determine that Donald Trump was not an eligible presidential candidate for 2024 over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election

Maine's top election official ruled Thursday, 28 December that former President Donald Trump would be removed from the state's presidential primary ballot next year.

Maine becomes the second state to determine that the former president is ineligible for running for office over his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.

The decision by the Secretary of State of Maine, Shenna Bellows, follows a Colorado Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that disqualified Trump from the state's ballot.

The Colorado Supreme Court ruling was deemed extraordinary because it was the first time that Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution was applied to disqualify a former president. 

That decision has not been enforced and has been stayed until the US Supreme Court decides whether Trump is barred under the amendment, which prohibits those who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding office.

The section was written after the Civil War to prevent former Confederate officers from returning to government.","Verse 1:
Maine ne faisla kiya, Trump ko hatane ka,
2024 ke presidential ballot se, election official ne diya yeh faisle ka khulaasad.
Pehli Colorado, ab Maine, dono states ne decide kiya,
Trump ko ineligible maana, 2020 election ke overturn attempts ke baad.

Chorus:
Trump ke khilaaf Section 3 of the 14th Amendment ka istemal,
Insurrection mein shamil hone wale ko rokne ke liye, yeh precedent ban gaya hai.
Maine aur Colorado, dono states ne kiya yeh faisla,
Trump ki eligibility ko lekar, ab Supreme Court ka intezar hai.

Verse 2:
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows ka faisla hai yeh,
Trump ko hatana, Maine ke presidential primary ballot se.
Pehle Colorado Supreme Court ne bhi diya tha yeh faisla,
Jisme Trump ko ban kiya gaya tha, Section 3 ke tahat.

Chorus:
Yeh amendment likha gaya tha Civil War ke baad,
Taaki former Confederate officers na ho sakein wapas government mein.
Ab yeh question hai Supreme Court ke saamne,
Kya Trump ko ban karna chahiye, ya usko milega presidential run ka moka."
